    <title>THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP</title>
 
<story>
    
<chapter number="1">

<p>
    <action char = "isaWhitney"><char gender = "male">Isa Whitney</char>, brother of the late <char gender = "male">Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal of the
Theological College of St. George’s</char>, was much addicted to opium.</action> The
habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some foolish freak when he
was at college;<action char = "isaWhitney"> for having read De Quincey’s description of his dreams
and sensations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt
to produce the same effects. He found, as so many more have done, that
the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years
he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror and
pity to his friends and relatives.</action> I can see him now, with yellow,
pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a
chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.
</p>

<p>
One night—it was in June, ’89—there came a ring to my bell, about the
hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock.<char gender = "male"> I</char> sat up
    in my chair, and <action char = "maryWatson"><char gender = "female">my wife</char> laid her needle-work down in her lap and made
a little face of disappointment.</action>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="maryWatson">A patient!</quote> said she. <quote speaker="maryWatson">You’ll have to go out.</quote>
</p>

<p>
I groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.
</p>

<p>
We heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps upon
the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and<action char = "kateWhitney"> <char gender = "female">a lady</char>, clad in some
dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.</action>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="kateWhitney">You will excuse my calling so late,</quote> she began, and then,<action char = "kateWhitney"> suddenly
losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my
wife’s neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. </action><quote speaker="kateWhitney">Oh, I’m in such trouble!</quote>
    she cried; <quote speaker="kateWhitney">I do so want a little help.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="maryWatson">Why,</quote> said <char gender = "female">my wife</char>,<action char = "maryWatson"> pulling up her veil</action>, <quote speaker="maryWatson">it is <char gender = "female">Kate Whitney.</char> How you
startled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when you came in.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="kateWhitney"><action char = "kateWhitney">I didn’t know what to do, so I came straight to you.</action></quote> That was always
the way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a
lighthouse.
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="maryWatson">It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and
water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or should you
rather that I sent <char gender = "male">James</char> off to bed?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="kateWhitney">Oh, no, no! I want<char gender = "male"> the doctor’s</char> advice and help, too. It’s about <action char = "isa"><char gender = "male">Isa.</char>
        He has not been home for two days.</action> <action char = "kateWhitney">I am so frightened about him!</action></quote>
</p>

<p>
    <action char = "kateWhitney">It was not the first time that she had spoken to us of <char gender = "male">her husband’s</char>
        trouble, to me as a doctor, to <char gender = "female">my wife</char> as an old friend and school
companion. </action> We soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find.
    Did she know where <char gender = "male">her husband </char>was? Was it possible that we could bring
him back to her?
</p>

<p>
    It seems that it was.<action char = "kateWhitney"> She had the surest information that of late he
had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest
east of the City.</action> Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one
    day, and he had come back, twitching and shattered, in the evening. <action char = "isaWhitney">But
now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay
there, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison
or sleeping off the effects. </action>There he was to be found, she was sure of
it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to do?
How could she, a young and timid woman, <action char = "kateWhitney">make her way into such a place
and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?</action>
</p>

<p>
There was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it.
Might I not escort her to this place? And then, as a second thought,
why should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney’s medical adviser, and as
such I had influence over him. I could manage it better if I were
alone. I promised her on my word that I would send him home in a cab
within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given
me. And so in ten minutes I had left my armchair and cheery
sitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a
strange errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only
could show how strange it was to be.
</p>

<p>
But there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure.
Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves
which line the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge.
Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of
steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the
den of which I was in search. Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down
the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken
feet; and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found
the latch and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with
the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the
forecastle of an emigrant ship.
</p>

<p>
Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in
strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown
back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark,
lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. Out of the black shadows
there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as
the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes. The
most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talked
together in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming
in gushes, and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling
out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his
neighbour. At the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal,
beside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old
man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his
knees, staring into the fire.
</p>

<p>
As I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for
me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="johnWatson">Thank you. I have not come to stay,</quote> said I. <quote speaker="johnWatson">There is a friend of
mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    There was<action char = "isaWhitney"> a movement and an exclamation from my right</action>, and peering
through the gloom, I saw <action char = "isaWhitney">Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring
out at me. </action>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="isaWhitney">My God! It’s Watson,</quote> said he. <action char = "isaWhitney">He was in a pitiable state of reaction,
    with every nerve in a twitter.</action> <quote speaker="isaWhitney">I say, Watson, what o’clock is it?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="johnWatson">Nearly eleven.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="isaWhitney">Of what day?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="johnWatson">Of Friday, June 19th.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="isaWhitney">Good heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What d’you
        want to frighten a chap for?</quote> <action char = "isaWhitney">He sank his face onto his arms and began
to sob in a high treble key.</action>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="johnWatson">I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting this two
days for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="isaWhitney"><action char = "isaWhitney">So I am.</action> But you’ve got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few
        hours, three pipes, four pipes—I forget how many. <action char = "isaWhitney">But I’ll go home with
you. I wouldn’t frighten Kate—poor little Kate.</action> Give me your hand! Have
you a cab?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="johnWatson">Yes, I have one waiting.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="isaWhitney">Then <action char = "isaWhitney">I shall go in it. But I must owe something.</action> Find what I owe,
Watson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself.</quote>
</p>

<p>
I walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers,
holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug,
and looking about for the manager. As I passed the tall man who sat by
the brazier I felt <action char="u_sherlockHolmes">a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice
    whispered, <quote speaker="u_sherlockHolmes">Walk past me, and then look back at me.</quote></action> The words fell
quite distinctly upon my ear. I glanced down. They could only have come
from the old man at my side, and yet <action char="u_sherlockHolmes">he sat now as absorbed as ever,
very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down
from between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude
from his fingers.</action> I took two steps forward and looked back. It took all
my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of
astonishment. <action char="sherlockHolmes">He had turned his back so that none could see him but I.
His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had
regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my
surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He made a slight motion
to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round
to the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped
senility.</action>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="johnWatson">Holmes!</quote> I whispered, <quote speaker="johnWatson">what on earth are you doing in this den?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">As low as you can,</quote> he answered; <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">I have excellent ears. If you would
have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours I
should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="johnWatson">I have a cab outside.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he
appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should recommend you
also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have
thrown in your lot with me. If you will wait outside, I shall be with
you in five minutes.</quote>
</p>

<p>
It was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes’ requests, for they
were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such a quiet
air of mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney was once confined in
the cab my mission was practically accomplished; and for the rest, I
could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in
one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his
existence. In a few minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney’s bill,
led him out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness. In a
very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den, and I
was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two streets he
shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot. Then, glancing
quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit
of laughter.
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">I suppose, Watson,</quote> said he, <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">that you imagine that I have added
opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little
weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="johnWatson">I was certainly surprised to find you there.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">But not more so than I to find you.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="johnWatson">I came to find a friend.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">And I to find an enemy.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="johnWatson">An enemy?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey.
Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and I
have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as
I have done before now. Had I been recognised in that den my life would
not have been worth an hour’s purchase; for I have used it before now
for my own purposes, and <action char="lascar">the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to
have vengeance upon me.</action> There is a trap-door at the back of that
building, near the corner of Paul’s Wharf, which could tell some
strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="johnWatson">What! You do not mean bodies?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had £ 1000 for every
poor devil who has been done to death in that den. It is the vilest
murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that <action char="nevilleStClair">Neville St. Clair
has entered it never to leave it more.</action> But our trap should be here.</quote> He
put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly—a signal
which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance, followed
shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses’ hoofs.
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Now, Watson,</quote> said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the
gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side
lanterns. <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">You’ll come with me, won’t you?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="johnWatson">If I can be of use.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so.
My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="johnWatson">The Cedars?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair’s house. I am staying there while I conduct
the inquiry.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="johnWatson">Where is it, then?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="johnWatson">But I am all in the dark.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Of course you are. You’ll know all about it presently. Jump up here.
All right, John; we shall not need you. Here’s half a crown. Look out
for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her head. So long, then!</quote>
</p>

<p>
He flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the
endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened
gradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with
the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another dull
wilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy,
regular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some
belated party of revellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the
sky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts
of the clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his
breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat beside
him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax
his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of
his thoughts. We had driven several miles, and were beginning to get to
the fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself,
shrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who
has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">You have a grand gift of silence, Watson,</quote> said he. <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">It makes you
quite invaluable as a companion. ’Pon my word, it is a great thing for
me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not
over-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear little
woman to-night when she meets me at the door.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">You forget that I know nothing about it.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get
to Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can get nothing to
go upon. There’s plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can’t get the end of
it into my hand. Now, I’ll state the case clearly and concisely to you,
Watson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Proceed, then.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Some years ago—to be definite, in May, 1884—there came <action char="nevilleStClair">to Lee a
gentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have plenty of
money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and
lived generally in good style. By degrees he made friends in the
neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer,
by whom he now has two children. He had no occupation, but was
interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the
morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon Street every night. Mr. St.
Clair is now thirty-seven years of age, is a man of temperate habits, a
good husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is popular with
all who know him. </action>I may add that his whole debts at the present moment,
as far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to £ 88 10_s_., while
he has £ 220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank.
There is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been
weighing upon his mind. “<action char="nevilleStClair">Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier than
usual, remarking before he started that he had two important
commissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home a
box of bricks. </action>Now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram
upon this same Monday, very shortly after his departure, to the effect
that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting
was waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company.
Now, if you are well up in your London, you will know that the office
of the company is in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam
Lane, where you found me to-night.<action char="mrsStClair"> Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch,
started for the City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company’s
office, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking
through Swandam Lane on her way back to the station.</action> Have you followed
me so far?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="johnWatson">It is very clear.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and <action char="mrsStClair">Mrs. St. Clair
walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did
not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself. While she was
walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an
ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold </action>to see <action char="nevilleStClair">her husband looking down
at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor
window.</action> The window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she
describes as being terribly agitated. <action char="nevilleStClair">He waved his hands frantically to
her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to
her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from
behind. </action>One singular point <action char="mrsStClair">which struck her quick feminine eye </action>was that
although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he
had on neither collar nor necktie.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    Convinced that something was amiss with him,<action char="mrsStClair"> she rushed down the
steps—for the house was none other than the opium den in which you
found me to-night—and running through the front room she attempted to
ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At the foot of the
stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel</action> of whom I have spoken,
<action char="lascar">who thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who acts as assistant there,
pushed her out into the street.</action> Filled with the most maddening doubts
    and fears, <action char="mrsStClair">she rushed down the lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in
Fresno Street a number of constables with an inspector, all on their
way to their beat.</action> The inspector and two men accompanied her back, and
in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their
way to the room in which<action char="nevilleStClair"> Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. </action>There was no
sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one
to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems,
made his home there. Both <action char="nevilleStClair">he and the<action char="lascar"> Lascar stoutly swore </action>></action>that no one
else had been in the front room during the afternoon. So determined was
their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to
believe that Mrs. St. Clair had been deluded when, <action char="mrsStClair">with a cry, she
sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid
from it. Out there fell a cascade of children’s bricks.</action> It was the toy
which<action char="NevilleStClair"> he had promised to bring home.</action>
</p>

<p>
“This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed,
made the inspector realise that the matter was serious. The rooms were
carefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime. The
front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small
bedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves. Between
the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low
tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of
water. The bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. On
examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill, and
several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the
bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the
clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of his coat. His
boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch—all were there. There were no
signs of violence upon any of these garments, and there were no other
traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair. Out of the window<action char="NevilleStClair"> he must apparently
have gone for no other exit could be discovered, and the ominous
bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save
himself by swimming,</action> for the tide was at its very highest at the moment
of the tragedy.
</p>

<p>
“And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in
the matter. The Lascar was known to <action char="lascar">be a man of the vilest antecedents,
but as, by Mrs. St. Clair’s story, he was known to have been at the
foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband’s appearance
at the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the
crime.</action> His defence was one of absolute ignorance, and<action char="lascar"> he protested that
he had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and
that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing
gentleman’s clothes.</action>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the <action char="hughBoone">sinister cripple who lives
upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the last
human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair. His name is Hugh
Boone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who
goes much to the City. He is a professional beggar, though in order to
avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax
vestas. Some little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the
left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in
the wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat,
cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a
piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy
leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I have watched the
fellow more than once before ever I thought of making his professional
acquaintance, and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has
reaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that
no one can pass him without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a
pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has
turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a pair
of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the
colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of
mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply
to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by.
This is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium
den, and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are
in quest.</action></quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="johnWatson">But a cripple!</quote> said I. <quote speaker="johnWatson">What could <action char="hughBoone">he have done single-handed against
a man in the prime of life?</action></quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">He is a cripple in the sense that <action char="hughBoone">he walks with a limp; but in other
respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man. </action>Surely your
medical experience would tell you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is
often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="johnWatson">Pray continue your narrative.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes"><action char="mrsStClair">Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window,
and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could
be of no help to them in their investigations. </action>Inspector Barton, who
had charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the
premises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the
matter. One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone instantly, as
he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated
with his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he
was seized and searched, without anything being found which could
incriminate him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his
right shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been
cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there,
adding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the
stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same
source. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr. Neville St. Clair
and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a
mystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. St. Clair’s assertion that
she had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she
must have been either mad or dreaming. He was removed, loudly
protesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon
the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh
clue.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had
feared to find. It was Neville St. Clair’s coat, and not Neville St.
Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And what do you think
they found in the pockets?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="johnWatson">I cannot imagine.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">No, I don’t think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with pennies
and half-pennies—421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It was no wonder
that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a human body is a
different matter. There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the
house. It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when
the stripped body had been sucked away into the river.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="johnWatson">But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room.
Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose that
this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window, there
is no human eye which could have seen the deed. What would he do then?
It would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the
tell-tale garments. He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of
throwing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not
sink. He has little time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when
the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard
from his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street.
There is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret hoard,
where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all
the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure
of the coat’s sinking. He throws it out, and would have done the same
with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and
only just had time to close the window when the police appeared.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="johnWatson">It certainly sounds feasible.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better.
Boone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but
it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against
him. He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life
appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one. There the matter
stands at present, and the questions which have to be solved—what
Neville St. Clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him when
there, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his
disappearance—are all as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I
cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first
glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties.</quote>
</p>

<p>
While Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of
events, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town
until the last straggling houses had been left behind, and we rattled
along with a country hedge upon either side of us. Just as he finished,
however, we drove through two scattered villages, where a few lights
still glimmered in the windows.
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">We are on the outskirts of Lee,</quote> said my companion. <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">We have touched
on three English counties in our short drive, starting in Middlesex,
passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent. See that light
among the trees? That is The Cedars, and beside that lamp sits a woman
whose anxious ears have already, I have little doubt, caught the clink
of our horse’s feet.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="johnWatson">But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?</quote> I asked.
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here. Mrs. St.
Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and you may rest
assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and
colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have no news of her
husband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!</quote>
</p>

<p>
We had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own
grounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse’s head, and springing
down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to
the house. As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde
woman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de
soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She
stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand
upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly
bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a
standing question.
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrsStClair">Well?</quote> she cried, <quote speaker="mrsStClair">well?</quote> And then, seeing that there were two of us,
she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my
companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrsStClair">No good news?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">None.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrsStClair">No bad?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">No.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrsStClair">Thank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have had a
long day.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">This is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to me in
several of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to
bring him out and associate him with this investigation.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrsStClair">I am delighted to see you,</quote> said she, pressing my hand warmly. <quote speaker="mrsStClair">You
will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our
arrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly
upon us.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="johnWatson">My dear madam,</quote> said I, <quote speaker="johnWatson">I am an old campaigner, and if I were not I
can very well see that no apology is needed. If I can be of any
assistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed
happy.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrsStClair">Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,</quote> said the lady as we entered a well-lit
dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out,
    <quote speaker="mrsStClair">I should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to
which I beg that you will give a plain answer.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Certainly, madam.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrsStClair">Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given to
fainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Upon what point?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrsStClair">In your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    Sherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question. <quote speaker="mrsStClair">Frankly,
now!</quote> she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at
him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Frankly, then, madam, I do not.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrsStClair">You think that he is dead?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">I do.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrsStClair">Murdered?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">I don’t say that. Perhaps.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrsStClair">And on what day did he meet his death?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">On Monday.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrsStClair">Then perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is
that I have received a letter from him to-day.</quote>
</p>

<p>
Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised.
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">What!</quote> he roared.
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrsStClair">Yes, to-day.</quote> She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in
the air.
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrsStClair">May I see it?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Certainly.</quote>
</p>

<p>
He snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon the
table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently. I had left my
chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The envelope was a very
coarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend postmark and with the
date of that very day, or rather of the day before, for it was
considerably after midnight.
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Coarse writing,</quote> murmured Holmes. <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Surely this is not your husband’s
writing, madam.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrsStClair">No, but the enclosure is.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and
inquire as to the address.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrsStClair">How can you tell that?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself.
The rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that blotting-paper has
been used. If it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none
would be of a deep black shade. This man has written the name, and
there has then been a pause before he wrote the address, which can only
mean that he was not familiar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but
there is nothing so important as trifles. Let us now see the letter.
Ha! there has been an enclosure here!</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrsStClair">Yes, there was a ring. His signet-ring.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">And you are sure that this is your husband’s hand?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrsStClair">One of his hands.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">One?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrsStClair">His hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual writing,
and yet I know it well.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrStClair">Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a huge
error which it may take some little time to rectify. Wait in
patience.—NEVILLE.</quote> Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book,
octavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in Gravesend by a man
with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has been gummed, if I am not very
much in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco. And you have
no doubt that it is your husband’s hand, madam?
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrsStClair">None. Neville wrote those words.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair, the
clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the danger is
over.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrStClair">But he must be alive, Mr. Holmes.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent. The
ring, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken from him.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrStClair">No, no; it is, it is his very own writing!</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Very well. It may, however, have been written on Monday and only
posted to-day.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrStClair">That is possible.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">If so, much may have happened between.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrStClair">Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is well
with him. There is so keen a sympathy between us that I should know if
evil came upon him. On the very day that I saw him last he cut himself
in the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room rushed upstairs instantly
with the utmost certainty that something had happened. Do you think
that I would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his
death?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be
more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner. And in
this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to
corroborate your view. But if your husband is alive and able to write
letters, why should he remain away from you?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrStClair">I cannot imagine. It is unthinkable.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrStClair">No.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrStClair">Very much so.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Was the window open?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrStClair">Yes.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Then he might have called to you?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrStClair">He might.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrStClair">Yes.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">A call for help, you thought?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrStClair">Yes. He waved his hands.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">But it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the
unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrStClair">It is possible.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">And you thought he was pulled back?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrStClair">He disappeared so suddenly.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">He might have leaped back. You did not see anyone else in the room?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrStClair">No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the
Lascar was at the foot of the stairs.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Quite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary
clothes on?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrStClair">But without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare throat.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrStClair">Never.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrStClair">Never.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about which
I wished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little supper and
then retire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow.</quote>
</p>

<p>
A large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our
disposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after
my night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when he
had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for
a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking
at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or
convinced himself that his data were insufficient. It was soon evident
to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. He took off
his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then
wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions
from the sofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of
Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an
ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him. In
the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe
between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the
ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with
the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. So he sat as I
dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me
to wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment. The
pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the
room was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap
of shag which I had seen upon the previous night.
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Awake, Watson?</quote> he asked.
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="johnWatson">Yes.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Game for a morning drive?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="johnWatson">Certainly.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy
sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out.</quote> He chuckled to himself as
he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the
sombre thinker of the previous night.
</p>

<p>
As I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one was
stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly finished
when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the
horse.
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">I want to test a little theory of mine,</quote> said he, pulling on his
    boots. <quote speaker="johnWatson">I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of
one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from
here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the key of the affair now.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="johnWatson">And where is it?</quote> I asked, smiling.
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">In the bathroom,</quote> he answered. <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Oh, yes, I am not joking,</quote> he
    continued, seeing my look of incredulity. <quote speaker="johnWatson">I have just been there, and
I have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag. Come on,
my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock.</quote>
</p>

<p>
We made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the
bright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and trap, with the
half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in, and away
we dashed down the London Road. A few country carts were stirring,
bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on
either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">It has been in some points a singular case,</quote> said Holmes, flicking the
    horse on into a gallop. <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">I confess that I have been as blind as a mole,
but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all.</quote>
</p>

<p>
In town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from
their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side.
Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and
dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the right and found
ourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well known to the force,
and the two constables at the door saluted him. One of them held the
horse’s head while the other led us in.
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Who is on duty?</quote> asked Holmes.
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="johnWatson">Inspector Bradstreet, sir.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?</quote> A tall, stout official had come down the
    stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">I wish to
have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="bradstreet">Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here.</quote>
</p>

<p>
It was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table,
and a telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his
desk.
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="bradstreet">What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">I called about that beggarman, Boone—the one who was charged with
being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="bradstreet">Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">So I heard. You have him here?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="bradstreet">In the cells.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Is he quiet?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="bradstreet">Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Dirty?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="bradstreet">Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is
as black as a tinker’s. Well, when once his case has been settled, he
will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would
agree with me that he needed it.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">I should like to see him very much.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="bradstreet">Would you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave your
bag.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">No, I think that I’ll take it.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="bradstreet">Very good. Come this way, if you please.</quote> He led us down a passage,
opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a
whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">The third on the right is his,</quote> said the inspector. <quote speaker="bradstreet">Here it is!</quote> He
quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced
through.
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="bradstreet">He is asleep,</quote> said he. <quote speaker="bradstreet">You can see him very well.</quote>
</p>

<p>
We both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his face
towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was
a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a
coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. He
was, as the inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which
covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness. A broad
wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its
contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three
teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red
hair grew low over his eyes and forehead.
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="bradstreet">He’s a beauty, isn’t he?</quote> said the inspector.
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">He certainly needs a wash,</quote> remarked Holmes. <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">I had an idea that he
might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.</quote> He opened
the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very
large bath-sponge.
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="bradstreet">He! he! You are a funny one,</quote> chuckled the inspector.
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very
quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="bradstreet">Well, I don’t know why not,</quote> said the inspector. <quote speaker="bradstreet">He doesn’t look a
credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?</quote> He slipped his key into the
lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper half
turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. Holmes
stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it
twice vigorously across and down the prisoner’s face.
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="bradstreet">Let me introduce you,</quote> he shouted, <quote speaker="bradstreet">to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee,
in the county of Kent.</quote>
</p>

<p>
Never in my life have I seen such a sight. The man’s face peeled off
under the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the coarse brown
tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and
the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A
twitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his
bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and
smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy
bewilderment. Then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a
scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="bradstreet">Great heavens!</quote> cried the inspector, <quote speaker="bradstreet">it is, indeed, the missing man.
I know him from the photograph.</quote>
</p>

<p>
The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself
to his destiny. <quote speaker="mrStClair">Be it so,</quote> said he. <quote speaker="mrStClair">And pray what am I charged with?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="bradstreet">With making away with Mr. Neville St.— Oh, come, you can’t be charged
with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it,</quote> said the
    inspector with a grin. <quote speaker="bradstreet">Well, I have been twenty-seven years in the
force, but this really takes the cake.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrStClair">If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has
been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally detained.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">No crime, but a very great error has been committed,</quote> said Holmes.
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">You would have done better to have trusted your wife.</quote>

    <quote speaker="mrStClair">It was not the wife; it was the children,</quote> groaned the prisoner. <quote speaker="mrStClair">God
help me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My God! What an
exposure! What can I do?</quote>

Sherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly
on the shoulder.

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,</quote> said he,
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">of course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand, if you
convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against
you, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should
find their way into the papers. Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure,
make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the
proper authorities. The case would then never go into court at all.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrStClair">God bless you!</quote> cried the prisoner passionately. <quote speaker="mrStClair">I would have endured
imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable
secret as a family blot to my children.</quote>

“You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a
schoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent education.
I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a
reporter on an evening paper in London. One day my editor wished to
have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and I
volunteered to supply them. There was the point from which all my
adventures started. It was only by trying begging as an amateur that I
could get the facts upon which to base my articles. When an actor I
had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been
famous in the green-room for my skill. I took advantage now of my
attainments. I painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as
possible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by
the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head
of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business
part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar.
For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in the
evening I found to my surprise that I had received no less than 26_s_.
4_d_.
</p>

<p>
“I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some
time later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me
for £ 25. I was at my wit’s end where to get the money, but a sudden
idea came to me. I begged a fortnight’s grace from the creditor, asked
for a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the
City under my disguise. In ten days I had the money and had paid the
debt.
</p>

<p>
“Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work
at £ 2 a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by
smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and
sitting still. It was a long fight between my pride and the money, but
the dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting and sat day after day
in the corner which I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly
face and filling my pockets with coppers. Only one man knew my secret.
He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam
Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the
evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. This
fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew
that my secret was safe in his possession.
</p>

<p>
“Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money.
I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn £ 700
a year—which is less than my average takings—but I had exceptional
advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of
repartee, which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised
character in the City. All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver,
poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take
£ 2.
</p>

<p>
“As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country,
and eventually married, without anyone having a suspicion as to my real
occupation. My dear wife knew that I had business in the City. She
little knew what.
</p>

<p>
“Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my room
above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw, to my
horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with
her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms
to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated
him to prevent anyone from coming up to me. I heard her voice
downstairs, but I knew that she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off
my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and
wig. Even a wife’s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But
then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and
that the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening by
my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the
bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by the
coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in
which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of the window, and it
disappeared into the Thames. The other clothes would have followed, but
at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few
minutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead of
being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his
murderer.
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrStClair">“I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I was
determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my
preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly
anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a
moment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried
scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">That note only reached her yesterday,</quote> said Holmes.
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrStClair">Good God! What a week she must have spent!</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="bradstreet">The police have watched this Lascar,</quote> said Inspector Bradstreet, <quote speaker="bradstreet">and
I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter
unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who
forgot all about it for some days.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">That was it,</quote> said Holmes, nodding approvingly; <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">I have no doubt of
it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrStClair">Many times; but what was a fine to me?</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="bradstreet">It must stop here, however,</quote> said Bradstreet. <quote speaker="bradstreet">If the police are to
hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="mrStClair">I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="johnWatson">In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be
taken. But if you are found again, then all must come out. I am sure,
Mr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared
the matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your results.</quote>
</p>

<p>
    <quote speaker="johnWatson">I reached this one,</quote> said my friend, <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">by sitting upon five pillows and
consuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker
Street we shall just be in time for breakfast.</quote>
