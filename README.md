## Research Questions
1. How often are characters of each gender given agency?

On occasion, Holmes brings a petitioner with him as an assistant/witness/informant 		while he investigates their case. Does he do this more frequently with men or women? Which gender does he most often leave behind? I expect women will more often play the role of damsel in distress, here.

1. Are men or women more likely to be adversaries?

I seem to recall more male adversaries in total throughout the works I have read, but which gender has a higher incidence rate of villainy? (I.e., the percentage of all women are antagonists compared to the percentage of men who are antagonists)
