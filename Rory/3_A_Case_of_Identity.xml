    <title>III. A CASE OF IDENTITY</title>
    <story>

        <p><quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“My dear fellow,”</quote> said Sherlock Holmes as we sat
            on either side of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, <quote
                speaker="sherlockHolmes">“life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind
                of man could invent. We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere
                commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover
                over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which
                are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the
                wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most
                outré results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen
                conclusions most stale and unprofitable.”</quote></p>

        <p><quote speaker="johnWatson">“And yet I am not convinced of it,”</quote> I answered.
                <quote speaker="johnWatson">“The cases which come to light in the papers are, as a
                rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed
                to its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither
                fascinating nor artistic.”</quote></p>

        <p><quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“A certain selection and discretion must be used in
                producing a realistic effect,”</quote> remarked Holmes. <quote
                speaker="sherlockHolmes">“This is wanting in the police report, where more stress is
                laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to
                an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there is
                nothing so unnatural as the commonplace.”</quote></p>

        <p>I smiled and shook my head. <quote speaker="johnWatson">“I can quite understand your
                thinking so,”</quote> I said. <quote speaker="johnWatson">“Of course, in your
                position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled,
                throughout three continents, you are brought in contact with all that is strange and
                bizarre. But here”</quote>—I picked up the morning paper from the ground—<quote
                speaker="johnWatson">“let us put it to a practical test. Here is the first heading
                upon which I come. ‘A husband’s cruelty to his wife.’ There is half a column of
                print, but I know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There
                is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the
                sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers could invent nothing more
                crude.”</quote></p>

        <p><quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your
                argument,”</quote> said Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it.
                <quote speaker="johnWatson">“This is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens,
                    <action char="sherlockHolmes">I was engaged in clearing up some small points in
                    connection with it</action>. The husband was a teetotaler, there was no other
                woman, and the conduct complained of was that <action char="u_husband">he had
                    drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth
                    and hurling them at his wife</action>, which, you will allow, is not an action
                likely to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller. Take a pinch of
                snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over you in your
            example.”</quote></p>

        <p>He held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid. Its
            splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that I could not help
            commenting upon it.</p>

        <p><quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“Ah,”</quote> said he, <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“I
                forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is a little souvenir from the King
                of Bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the Irene Adler
                papers.”</quote></p>

        <p><quote speaker="johnWatson">“And the ring?”</quote> I asked, glancing at a remarkable
            brilliant which sparkled upon his finger.</p>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the
                matter in which I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to
                you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little
                problems.”</quote>
        </p>

        <p><quote speaker="johnWatson">“And have you any on hand just now?”</quote> I asked with
            interest.</p>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature
                of interest. They are important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed,
                I have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the
                observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to
                an investigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the
                crime the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive. In these cases, save for one
                rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is
                nothing which presents any features of interest. It is possible, however, that I may
                have something better before very many minutes are over, for this is one of my
                clients, or I am much mistaken.”</quote>
        </p>

        <p>He had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into
            the dull neutral-tinted London street. Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on the
            pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a
            large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish
            Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear. <action char="marySutherland">From under
                this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows,
                while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her
                glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves the bank, she
                hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of the bell</action>.</p>

        <p><quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“I have seen those symptoms before,”</quote> said Holmes,
            throwing his cigarette into the fire. <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“Oscillation upon
                the pavement always means an _affaire de cœur_. She would like advice, but is not
                sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may
                discriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer
                oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that
                there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or
                grieved. <action char="marySutherland">But here she comes in person to resolve our
                    doubts</action>.”</quote></p>

        <p>As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered to announce Miss
            Mary Sutherland, <action char="marySutherland">while the lady herself loomed behind his
                small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot
            boat</action>. <action char="sherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy
                courtesy for which he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into
                an armchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was
                peculiar to him</action>.</p>

        <p><quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“Do you not find,”</quote> he said, <quote
                speaker="sherlockHolmes">“that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so
                much typewriting?”</quote></p>

        <p><quote speaker="marySutherland">“I did at first,”</quote> she answered, <quote
                speaker="marySutherland">“but now I know where the letters are without
                looking.”</quote> Then, <action char="marySutherland">suddenly realising the full
                purport of his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and
                astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. <quote speaker="marySutherland"
                    >“You’ve heard about me, Mr. Holmes,”</quote> she cried</action>, <quote
                speaker="marySutherland">“else how could you know all that?”</quote></p>

        <p><quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“Never mind,”</quote> said Holmes, laughing; <quote
                speaker="sherlockHolmes">“it is my business to know things. Perhaps I have trained
                myself to see what others overlook. If not, why should you come to consult
                me?”</quote></p>


        <p>
            <quote speaker="marySutherland">“I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs.
                    Etherege,<action char="sherlockHolmes"> whose husband you found so easy when the
                    police and everyone had given him up for dead</action>. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish
                you would do as much for me. I’m not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my
                own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to
                know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel.”</quote>
        </p>

        <p><quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“Why did you come away to consult me in such a
                hurry?”</quote> asked Sherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to
            the ceiling.</p>

        <p><action char="marySutherland">Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face
                of Miss Mary Sutherland</action>. <quote speaker="marySutherland">“Yes, I did bang
                out of the house,”</quote> she said, <quote speaker="marySutherland">“for it made me
                angry to see the easy way in which <action char="jamesWindibank">Mr. Windibank—that
                    is, my father—took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not go to
                    you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no
                    harm done</action>, <action char="marySutherland">it made me mad, and I just on
                    with my things and came right away to you</action>.”</quote></p>

        <p><quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“Your father,”</quote> said Holmes, <quote
                speaker="sherlockHolmes">“your stepfather, surely, since the name is
                different.”</quote></p>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="marySutherland">“Yes, my stepfather. <action char="marySutherland">I
                    call him father</action>, though it sounds funny, too, for he is only five years
                and two months older than myself.”</quote>
        </p>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“And your mother is alive?”</quote>
        </p>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="marySutherland">“Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn’t best
                pleased, Mr. Holmes, when <action char="mrsSutherland">she married again so soon
                    after father’s death, and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than
                    herself</action>. Father was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left
                a tidy business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but
                when Mr. Windibank came <action char="jamesWindibank">he made her sell the business,
                    for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines</action>. They got £ 4700
                for the goodwill and interest, which wasn’t near as much as father could have got if
                he had been alive.”</quote>
        </p>

        <p>I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential
            narrative, but, on the contrary, <action char="sherlockHolmes">he had listened with the
                greatest concentration of attention.</action></p>

        <p><quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“Your own little income,”</quote> he asked, <quote
                speaker="sherlockHolmes">“does it come out of the business?”</quote></p>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="marySutherland">“Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was <action
                    char="ned">left me by my uncle Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock,
                    paying 4½ per cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount</action>,
                but I can only touch the interest.”</quote>
        </p>

        <p><quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“You interest me extremely,”</quote> said Holmes. <quote
                speaker="sherlockHolmes">“And since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year,
                with what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge
                yourself in every way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an
                income of about £ 60.”</quote></p>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="marySutherland">“I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but
                you understand that as long as I live at home I don’t wish to be a burden to them,
                and so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of course,
                that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and
                pays it over to mother, and <action char="marySutherland">I find that I can do
                    pretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and
                    I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day.</action>”</quote>
        </p>

        <p><quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“You have made your position very clear to me,”</quote>
            said Holmes. <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom
                you can speak as freely as before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your
                connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel.”</quote></p>

        <p>A flush stole over Miss Sutherland’s face, and she picked nervously at the fringe of her
            jacket. <quote speaker="marySutherland">“I met him first at the gasfitters’
                ball,”</quote> she said. <quote speaker="marySutherland">“They used to send father
                tickets when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to
                mother. <action char="jamesWindibank">Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He never
                    did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I wanted so much as to
                    join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I was set on going, and I would go;
                    for what right had he to prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know,
                    when all father’s friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit
                    to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken out of the
                    drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to France upon the
                    business of the firm</action>, but we went, mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who
                used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel.”</quote></p>

        <p><quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“I suppose,”</quote> said Holmes, <quote
                speaker="sherlockHolmes">“that when <action char="jamesWindibank">Mr. Windibank came
                    back from France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the
                ball</action>.”</quote></p>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="marySutherland">“Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I
                remember, and shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to
                a woman, for she would have her way.”</quote>
        </p>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“I see. Then at the gasfitters’ ball you met, as I
                understand, a gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel.”</quote>
        </p>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="marySutherland">“Yes, sir. <action char="marySutherland">I met him that
                    night, and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe, and after that
                    we met him—that is to say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks</action>, but
                after that father came back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house
                any more.”</quote>
        </p>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“No?”</quote>
        </p>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="marySutherland">“Well, you know father didn’t like anything of the sort.
                    <action char="mrSutherland">He wouldn’t have any visitors if he could help it,
                    and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family
                    circle</action>. But then, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own
                circle to begin with, and I had not got mine yet.”</quote>
        </p>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt
                to see you?”</quote>
        </p>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="marySutherland">“Well, <action char="mrSutherland">father was going off
                    to France again in a week</action>, and <action char="hosmerAngel">Hosmer wrote
                    and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had
                    gone</action>. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every day. I
                took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for father to
                know.”</quote>
        </p>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“Were you engaged to the gentleman at this
                time?”</quote>
        </p>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="marySutherland">“Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first
                walk that we took. Hosmer—Mr. Angel—was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall
                Street—and—”</quote>
        </p>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“What office?”</quote>
        </p>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="marySutherland">“That’s the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don’t

        </p>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“Where did he live, then?”</quote>
        </p>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="marySutherland">“He slept on the premises.”</quote>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“And you don’t know his address?”</quote>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="marySutherland">“No—except that it was Leadenhall Street.”</quote>

            <quote speaker="marySutherland">“To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till
                called for. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all

        <p>Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together,

            Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a
            counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue
            cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.</p>

                Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which
                were new to me. But the maiden herself was most instructive.”</quote></p>

            <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know

                realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or the great
                issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you gather from that woman’s
                appearance? Describe it.”</quote>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="johnWatson">“Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat,
                with a feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon
                it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown, rather darker
                than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves
                were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn’t
                observe. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a general air of being
                fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.”</quote>
        </p>

        <p>Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.</p>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“’Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully.
                You have really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed everything of
                importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you have a quick eye for colour.
                Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details.
                    <action char="sherlockHolmes">My first glance is always at a woman’s sleeve. In
                    a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you
                    observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most useful material
                    for showing traces. The double line a little above the wrist, where the
                    typewritist presses against the table, was beautifully defined. The
                    sewing-machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left
                    arm, and on the side of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right
                    across the broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and,
                    observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a
                    remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise
                her</action>.”</quote>
        </p>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="johnWatson">“It surprised me.”</quote>
        </p>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised
                and interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was
                wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one having a
                slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was buttoned only in the
                two lower buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth. Now,
                when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home
                with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in
                a hurry.”</quote>
        </p>

        <p><quote speaker="johnWatson">“And what else?”</quote> I asked, keenly interested, as I
            always was, by my friend’s incisive reasoning.</p>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“<action char="sherlockHolmes">I noted, in passing, that
                    she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed. You
                    observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not
                    apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She had
                    written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been this morning,
                    or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing, though
                    rather elementary, but I must go back to business,</action> Watson. Would you
                mind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?”</quote>

            built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black
            side-whiskers and moustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed,

            and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots. Known to

        <p><quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“That will do,”</quote> said Holmes.<quote
                speaker="sherlockHolmes">“As to the letters,”</quote> he continued, glancing over
            them, <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“they are very commonplace. Absolutely no clue in
                them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one remarkable point,

        <p><quote speaker="johnWatson">“They are typewritten,”</quote> I remarked.</p>

            <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">"Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look

                superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The point about the
                signature is very suggestive—in fact, we may call it conclusive.”</quote>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="johnWatson">“I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be

                instituted.”</quote>

            <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“No, that was not the point. However, <action

                    evening.</action> It is just as well that we should do business with the male
                relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the answers to those letters

        </p>

        <p>I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend’s subtle powers of reasoning and
            extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must have some solid grounds for the
            assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been
            called upon to fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of
            Bohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to the weird business
            of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study in
            Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.</p>

                char="sherlockHolmes">he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the
                identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland</action>.</p>

        <p>A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time, and the
            whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer. It was not until close upon
            six o’clock that I found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to
            Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too late to assist at the _dénouement_ of the
            little mystery. I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin
            form curled up in the recesses of his armchair. A formidable array of bottles and
            test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had
            spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.</p>

        <p><quote speaker="johnWatson">“Well, have you solved it?”</quote> I asked as I entered.</p>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta.”</quote>
        </p>

        <p><quote speaker="johnWatson">“No, no, the mystery!”</quote> I cried.</p>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been
                working upon. There was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said
                yesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only drawback is that there is
                no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.”</quote>
        </p>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="johnWatson">“Who was he, then, and <action char="hosmerAngel">what was
                    his object in deserting Miss Sutherland</action>?”</quote>
        </p>

        <p>The question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply,
            when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door.</p>

        <p><quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“This is the girl’s stepfather, Mr. James
                Windibank,”</quote> said Holmes. <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“He has written to
                me to say that he would be here at six. Come in!”</quote></p>

        <p>The man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty years of age,
            clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner, and a pair of
            wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of us,
            placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the
            nearest chair.</p>

        <p><quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank,”</quote> said Holmes.
                <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“I think that this typewritten letter is from you,
                in which <action char="jamesWindibank">you made an appointment with me for six
                    o’clock?</action>”</quote></p>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="jamesWindibank">“Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am
                not quite my own master, you know. I am sorry that <action char="marySutherland"
                    >Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this little matter</action>, for I think
                it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public. It was quite against my
                wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have
                noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point.
                Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the official
                police, but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad.
                Besides, it is a useless expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer
                Angel?”</quote>
        </p>

        <p><quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“On the contrary,”</quote> said Holmes quietly; <quote
                speaker="sherlockHolmes">“I have every reason to believe that I will succeed in
                discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel.”</quote></p>

        <p>Mr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. <quote
                speaker="jamesWindibank">“I am delighted to hear it,”</quote> he said.</p>

        <p><quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“It is a curious thing,”</quote> remarked Holmes, <quote
                speaker="sherlockHolmes">“that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality
                as a man’s handwriting. Unless they are quite new, no two of them write exactly
                alike. Some letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now,
                you remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some
                little slurring over of the ‘e,’ and a slight defect in the tail of the ‘r.’ There
                are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more obvious.”</quote></p>

        <p><quote speaker="jamesWindibank">“We do all our correspondence with this machine at the
                office, and no doubt it is a little worn,”</quote>
            <action char="jamesWindibank">our visitor answered, glancing keenly at Holmes with his
                bright little eyes</action>.</p>

        <p><quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“And now I will show you what is really a very
                interesting study, Mr. Windibank,”</quote> Holmes continued. <quote
                speaker="sherlockHolmes">“I think of writing another little monograph some of these
                days on the typewriter and its relation to crime. It is a subject to which I have
                devoted some little attention. I have here four letters which purport to come from
                the missing man. They are all typewritten. In each case, not only are the ‘e’s’
                slurred and the ‘r’s’ tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my
                magnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I have alluded are
                there as well.”</quote></p>

        <p><action char="jamesWindibank">Mr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his
                hat</action>. <quote speaker="jamesWindibank">“I cannot waste time over this sort of
                fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,”</quote> he said. <quote speaker="jamesWindibank">“If
                you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done
            it.”</quote></p>

        <p><quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“Certainly,”</quote> said Holmes, <action
                char="sherlockHolmes">stepping over and turning the key in the door</action>. <quote
                speaker="sherlockHolmes">“I let you know, then, that I have caught him!”</quote></p>

        <p><quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“What! where?”</quote> shouted Mr. Windibank, turning
            white to his lips and glancing about him like a rat in a trap.</p>

        <p><quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“Oh, it won’t do—really it won’t,”</quote> said Holmes
            suavely. <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“There is no possible getting out of it, Mr.
                Windibank. It is quite too transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you
                said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That’s right! Sit
                down and let us talk it over.”</quote></p>

        <p>Our visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his
            brow. <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“It—it’s not actionable,”</quote> he
            stammered.</p>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“I am very much afraid that it is not. But between
                ourselves, Windibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty
                way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the course of events, and you
                will contradict me if I go wrong.”</quote>
        </p>

        <p>The man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his breast, like one who is
            utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning
            back with his hands in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than
            to us.</p>

        <p><quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“The man married a woman very much older than himself for
                her money,”</quote> said he, <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“and he enjoyed the use
                of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable
                sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious
                difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good,
                amiable disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was
                evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would not
                be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, of course, the loss
                of a hundred a year, so what does her stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the
                obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of
                people of her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever. She
                became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her positive
                intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He
                conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. With the connivance
                and assistance of his wife he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted
                glasses, masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that
                clear voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl’s
                short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making
                love himself.”</quote></p>

        <p><quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“It was only a joke at first,”</quote> groaned our
            visitor. <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“We never thought that she would have been so
                carried away.”</quote></p>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady
                was very decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her
                stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered
                her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman’s attentions, and the effect was
                increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to
                call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a
                real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an engagement, which would
                finally secure the girl’s affections from turning towards anyone else. But the
                deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys to France were
                rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such
                a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady’s
                mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come. Hence
                those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a
                possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding. James
                Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as
                to his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to
                another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no
                farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door
                of a four-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of events, Mr.
                Windibank!”</quote>
        </p>

        <p>Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had been talking, and
            he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face.</p>

        <p><quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes,”</quote> said
            he, <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp
                enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now, and not me. I have done
                nothing actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay
                yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint.”</quote></p>

        <p><quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“The law cannot, as you say, touch you,”</quote> said
            Holmes, unlocking and throwing open the door, <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“yet there
                never was a man who deserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a
                friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!”</quote> he
            continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man’s face, <quote
                speaker="sherlockHolmes">“it is not part of my duties to my client, but here’s a
                hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just treat myself to—”</quote> He took two
            swift steps to the whip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps
            upon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr. James
            Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road.</p>

        <p><quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“There’s a cold-blooded scoundrel!”</quote> said Holmes,
            laughing, as he threw himself down into his chair once more. <quote
                speaker="sherlockHolmes">“That fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does
                something very bad, and ends on a gallows. The case has, in some respects, been not
                entirely devoid of interest.”</quote></p>

        <p><quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your
                reasoning,”</quote> I remarked.</p>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this
                Mr. Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was
                equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as far as we
                could see, was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together,
                but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. So were
                the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did
                the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in
                typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so
                familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it. You see all
                these isolated facts, together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same
                direction.”</quote>
        </p>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“And how did you verify them?”</quote>
        </p>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get
                corroboration. I knew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed
                description. I eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a
                disguise—the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to the firm, with a
                request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of
                their travellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I
                wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here.
                As I expected, his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but
                characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from Westhouse &amp;
                Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description tallied in every respect
                with that of their employé, James Windibank. Voilà tout!”</quote>
        </p>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“And Miss Sutherland?”</quote>
        </p>

        <p>
            <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">“If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember
                the old Persian saying, ‘There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and
                danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.’ There is as much sense in
