<story>
    <p>The Lord <char gender = "male" name = "robertstSimon">St. Simon</char> marriage, and its curious termination, have long
ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which
the unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and
their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this
four-year-old drama. As I have reason to believe, however, that the
full facts have never been revealed to the general public, and as my
friend Sherlock <char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char> had a considerable share in clearing the matter
up, I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little
sketch of this remarkable episode.</p><p>It was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was
still sharing rooms with <char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char> in Baker Street, that <action><char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">he</char> came home from
an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him</action>. I
had remained indoors all day, for the weather had taken a sudden turn
to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the jezail bullet which I had
brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign
throbbed with dull persistence. With my body in one easy-chair and my
legs upon another, <action><char gender = "male" name = "johnWatson">I</char> had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers
until at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all
aside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the
envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend’s noble
correspondent could be.</action></p><p><quote speaker = "johnWatson">Here is a very fashionable epistle,</quote> I remarked as he entered. <quote speaker = "johnWatson">Your
morning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and a
tide-waiter.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "Sherlock">Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,</quote> he
answered, smiling, <quote speaker = "Sherlock">and the humbler are usually the more interesting.
This looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon
a man either to be bored or to lie.</quote></p><p><action><char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">He</char> broke the seal and glanced over the contents.</action></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "johnWatson">Not social, then?</quote>
<quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">No, distinctly professional.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "johnWatson">And from a noble client?</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">One of the highest in England.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "johnWatson">My dear fellow, I congratulate you.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">I assure you, <char gender = "male" name = "johnWatson">Watson</char>, without affectation, that the status of my
client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case.
It is just possible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this
new investigation. You have been reading the papers diligently of late,
have you not?</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "johnWatson">It looks like it,</quote> said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the
corner. <quote speaker = "johnWatson">I have had nothing else to do.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I read
nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The latter is
always instructive. But if you have followed recent events so closely
you must have read about Lord <char gender = "male" name = "robertstSimon">St. Simon</char> and his wedding?</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "johnWatson">Oh, yes, with the deepest interest.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">That is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from <char gender = "male" name = "robertstSimon">Lord Robert St. Simon</char>. I will read it to you, and in return you must turn over these
papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter. This is what he
says:</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes"><subq speaker = "robertstSimon">MY DEAR MR. <char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">SHERLOCK HOLMES</char>,—<char gender = "male" name = "lordBackwater">Lord Backwater</char> tells me that I may
    place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. <action><char gender = "male" name = "robertstSimon">I</char> have
    determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you in
    reference to the very painful event which has occurred in
    connection with my wedding.</action> <action><char gender ="male" name = "detectiveLestrade">Mr. Lestrade</char>, of Scotland Yard, is
    acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no
    objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that it
    might be of some assistance.</action> I will call at four o’clock in the
    afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that time,
    I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of paramount
    importance. Yours faithfully,</subq></quote></p><p>

<quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the
noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer
side of his right little finger,</quote> remarked <char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char> as he folded up the
epistle.</p><p><quote speaker = "johnWatson">He says four o’clock. It is three now. He will be here in an hour.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the
subject. Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order
of time, while I take a glance as to who our client is.</quote> <action><char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">He</char> picked a
red-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the
mantelpiece</action>. <quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">Here he is,</quote> said he, sitting down and flattening it out
upon his knee. <quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes"><subq speaker = "Journalist">Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere <char gender = "male" name = "robertstSimon">St. Simon</char>, second son
    of the <char gender = "male" name = "dukeBalmoral">Duke of Balmoral</char>.</subq> Hum! <subq speaker = "Journalist">Arms: Azure, three caltrops in chief
over a fess sable. Born in 1846.</subq> He’s forty-one years of age, which is
mature for marriage. Was Under-Secretary for the colonies in a late
administration. <char gender = "male" name = "dukeBalmoral">The Duke</char>, his father, was at one time Secretary for
Foreign Affairs. They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and
Tudor on the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive
in all this. I think that I must turn to you <char gender = "male" name = "johnWatson">Watson</char>, for something more
solid.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "johnWatson">I have very little difficulty in finding what I want,</quote> said I, <quote speaker = "johnWatson">for
the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. I
feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry
on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van.
That is quite cleared up now—though, indeed, it was obvious from the
first. Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "johnWatson">Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal
column of the _Morning Post_, and dates, as you see, some weeks back:
<subq speaker = "Journalist">A marriage has been arranged,</subq> it says, <subq speaker = "Journalist">and will, if rumour is
correct, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert <char gender = "male" name = "robertstSimon">St. Simon</char>, second
son of the Duke of Balmoral, and <char gender = "female" name = "hattyDoran">Miss Hatty Doran</char>, the only daughter of
    <char gender = "male" name = "aloysiusDoran">Aloysius Doran</char>. Esq., of San Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.</subq> That is all.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">Terse and to the point,</quote> remarked <action><char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char>, stretching</action> his long, thin
legs towards the fire.</p><p><quote speaker = "johnWatson">There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of
the same week. Ah, here it is: <subq speaker = "Journalist">There will soon be a call for
protection in the marriage  market, for the present free-trade
principle appears to tell heavily against our home product. One by one
the management of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the
hands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic. An important
addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes
which have been borne away by these charming invaders. <action>Lord <char gender = "male" name = "robertstSimon">St. Simon</char>,
who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little
god’s arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage</action>
with <char gender = "female" name = "hattyDoran">Miss Hatty Doran</char>, the fascinating daughter of a California
millionaire. <action><char gender = "female" name = "hattyDoran">Miss Doran</char>, whose graceful figure and striking face
attracted much attention at the Westbury House festivities</action>, is an only
child, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to
considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future. As
it is an open secret that the <action><char gender = "male" name = "dukeBalmoral">Duke of Balmoral</char> has been compelled to
sell his pictures within the last few years</action>, and as Lord <char gender = "male" name = "robertstSimon">St. Simon</char> has
no property of his own save the small estate of Birchmoor, it is
obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an
alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition
from a Republican lady to a British peeress.</subq></quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">Anything else?</quote> asked <action><char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char>, yawning</action>.</p><p><quote speaker = "johnWatson">Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the _Morning Post_ to
say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would
be at St. George’s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate
friends would be invited, and that the party would return to the
furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by <char gender = "male" name = "aloysiusDoran">Mr. Aloysius
    Doran</char>. Two days later—that is, on Wednesday last—there is a curt
announcement that the wedding had taken place, and that the honeymoon
would be passed at Lord Backwater’s place, near Petersfield. Those are
all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">Before the what?</quote> asked <char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char> with a start.</p><p><quote speaker = "johnWatson">The vanishing of the lady.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">When did she vanish, then?</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "johnWatson">At the wedding breakfast.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite
dramatic, in fact.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "johnWatson">Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the
honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this.
Pray let me have the details.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "johnWatson">I warn you that they are very incomplete.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">Perhaps we may make them less so.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "johnWatson">Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning
paper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is headed, <subq speaker = "Journalist">Singular
Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding</subq>:</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "johnWatson"><subq speaker = "Journalist">The family of Lord Robert <char gender = "male" name = "robertstSimon">St. Simon</char> has been thrown into the greatest
consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken
place in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as shortly
announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning;
but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange
rumours which have been so persistently floating about. In spite of the
attempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public attention
has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by
affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation.</subq></quote></p><p><quote speaker = "johnWatson"><subq speaker = "Journalist">The ceremony, which was performed at St. George’s, Hanover Square,
was a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the
bride, <char gender = "male" name = "aloysiusDoran">Mr. Aloysius Doran</char>, <char gender = "female" name = "duchessBalmoral">the Duchess of Balmoral</char>, <char gender = "male" name = "lordBackwater">Lord Backwater</char>,
    <char gender = "male" name = "lordEustace">Lord Eustace</char> and <char gender = "female" name = "ladyClara">Lady Clara</char> (the younger brother and sister
    of the bridegroom), and <char gender = "female" name = "aliciaWhittington">Lady Alicia Whittington</char>. The whole party
    proceeded afterwards to the house of <char gender = "male" name = "aloysiusDoran">Mr. Aloysius Doran</char>, at Lancaster
Gate, where breakfast had been prepared. It appears that some little
trouble was caused by <action><char gender = "female" name = "floraMillar">a woman</char>, whose name has not been ascertained, who
endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party,
alleging that she had some claim</action> upon Lord <char gender = "male" name = "robertstSimon">St. Simon</char>. It was only after
a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and
the footman. <action><char gender = "female" name = "hattyDoran">The bride</char>, who had fortunately entered the house before
this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest,
when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room</action>.
Her prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed
her, but learned from her maid that <action><char gender = "female" name = "hattyDoran">she</char> had only come up to her chamber
for an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the
passage</action>. One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the
house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his
mistress, believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that
his daughter had disappeared, <action><char gender = "male" name = "aloysiusDoran">Mr. Aloysius Doran</char>, in conjunction with
the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with the
police, and very energetic inquiries are being made</action>, which will
probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business.
Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the
whereabouts of the missing lady. There are rumours of foul play in the
matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the
woman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from
jealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the
strange disappearance of the bride.</subq></quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">And is that all?</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "johnWatson">Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a
suggestive one.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">And it is—</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "johnWatson">That <action><char gender = "female" name = "floraMillar">Miss Flora Millar</char>, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has
actually been arrested</action>. It appears that she was formerly a _danseuse_
at the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom for some years.
There are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands
now—so far as it has been set forth in the public press.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would not have
missed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell, <char gender = "male" name = "johnWatson">Watson</char>, and as
the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this
will prove to be our noble client. Do not dream of going, <char gender = "male" name = "johnWatson">Watson</char>, for I
very much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own
memory.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "page-boy">Lord Robert <char gender = "male" name = "robertstSimon">St. Simon</char>,</quote> announced our <action><char gender = "male" name = "pageBoy">page-boy</char>, throwing open the
door</action>. <action><char gender = "male" name = "robertstSimon">A gentleman</char> entered</action>, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed
and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with
the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever
been to command and to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his
general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight
forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked. His hair,
too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the
edges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the
verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white
waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured
gaiters. <action><char gender = "male" name = "robertstSimon">He </char>advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left
to right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden
eyeglasses</action>.</p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">Good-day, Lord <char gender = "male" name = "robertstSimon">St. Simon</char>,</quote> said <action><char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char>, rising and bowing</action>. <quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">Pray take
the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. <char gender = "male" name = "johnWatson">Watson</char>. Draw up
a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "robertstSimon">A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr.
<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char>. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you have
already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I
presume that they were hardly from the same class of society.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">No, I am descending.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "robertstSimon">I beg pardon.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">My last client of the sort was a king.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "robertstSimon">Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">The King of Scandinavia.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "robertstSimon">What! Had he lost his wife?</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">You can understand,</quote> said <char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char> suavely, <quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">that I extend to the
affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in
yours.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "robertstSimon">Of course! Very right! very right! I’m sure I beg pardon. As to my own
case, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in
forming an opinion.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints,
nothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct—this article, for
example, as to the disappearance of the bride.</quote></p><p>Lord <char gender = "male" name = "robertstSimon">St. Simon</char> glanced over it. <quote speaker = "robertstSimon">Yes, it is correct, as far as it
goes.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer
an opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by
questioning you.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "robertstSimon">Pray do so.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">When did you first meet <char gender = "female" name = "hattyDoran">Miss Hatty Doran</char>?</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "robertstSimon">In San Francisco, a year ago.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">You were travelling in the States?</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "robertstSimon">Yes.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">Did you become engaged then?</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "robertstSimon">No.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">But you were on a friendly footing?</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "robertstSimon">I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">Her father is very rich?</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "robertstSimon">He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">And how did he make his money?</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "robertstSimon">In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold,
invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady’s—your wife’s
character?</quote></p><p>The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the
fire. <quote speaker = "robertstSimon">You see, Mr. <char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char>,</quote> said he, <quote speaker = "robertstSimon">my wife was twenty before her
father became a rich man. During that time <action><char gender = "female" name = "hattyDoran">she</char> ran free in a mining
camp and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has
come from Nature rather than from the schoolmaster</action>. She is what we call
in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by
any sort of traditions. She is impetuous—volcanic, I was about to say.
She is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her
resolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the name
which I have the honour to bear</quote>—<action><char gender = "male" name = "robertstSimon">he</char> gave a little stately cough</action>—<quote speaker = "robertstSimon">had I
not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. <action><char gender = "male" name = "robertstSimon">I</char> believe that she is
capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would
be repugnant to her</action>.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">Have you her photograph?</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "robertstSimon">I brought this with me.</quote> <action><char gender = "male" name = "robertstSimon">He</char> opened a locket and showed us the full
face of a very lovely woman</action>. It was not a photograph but an ivory
miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the
lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth.
<action><char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char> gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he closed the locket and
handed it back</action> to Lord <char gender = "male" name = "robertstSimon">St. Simon</char>.</p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your
acquaintance?</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "robertstSimon">Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I met
her several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "robertstSimon">A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a _fait
accompli_?</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "robertstSimon">I really have made no inquiries on the subject.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">Very naturally not. Did you see <char gender = "female" name = "hattyDoran">Miss Doran</char> on the day before the
wedding?</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "robertstSimon">Yes.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">Was she in good spirits?</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "robertstSimon">Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our future
lives.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the wedding?</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "robertstSimon">She was as bright as possible—at least until after the ceremony.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">And did you observe any change in her then?</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "robertstSimon">Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever
seen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident however, was
too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">Pray let us have it, for all that.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "robertstSimon">Oh, it is childish. <action><char gender = "female" name ="hattyDoran">She</char> dropped her bouquet as we went towards the
vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over
into the pew</action>. There was a moment’s delay, but <action><char gender = "male" name = "francisMoulton">the gentleman in the pew</char>
handed it up to her again</action>, and it did not appear to be the worse for
the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of the matter, <action><char gender = "female" name = "hattyDoran">she</char> answered me
abruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly
agitated over this trifling cause</action>.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the
general public were present, then?</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "robertstSimon">Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">This gentleman was not one of your wife’s friends?</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "robertstSimon">No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a
common-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But really I
think that we are wandering rather far from the point.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">Lady <char gender = "female" name = "hattyDoran">St. Simon</char>, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful
frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering
her father’s house?</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "robertstSimon">I saw her in conversation with her maid.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">And who is her maid?</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "robertstSimon"><char gender = "female" name = "alice">Alice</char> is her name. She is an American and came from California with
her.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">A confidential servant?</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "robertstSimon">A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to
take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look upon these
things in a different way.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">How long did she speak to this <char gender = "female" name = "alice">Alice</char>?</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "robertstSimon">Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">You did not overhear what they said?</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "robertstSimon">Lady <char gender = "female" name = "hattyDoran">St. Simon</char> said something about <subq speaker = "Alice">jumping a claim.</subq> She was
accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she meant.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do
when she finished speaking to her maid?</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "robertstSimon">She walked into the breakfast-room.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">On your arm?</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "robertstSimon">No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that. Then,
after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, <action><char gender = "female" name = "hattyDoran">she</char> rose hurriedly,
muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She never came
back.</action></quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">But this maid, <action><char gender = "female" name = "alice">Alice</char>, as I understand, deposes that she went to her
room, covered her bride’s dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet,
and went out</action>.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "robertstSimon">Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in
company with <char gender = "female" name = "hattyDoran">Miss Hatty Doran</char>, a woman who is now in custody, and who had
    already made a disturbance at <char gender = "male" name = "aloysiusDoran">Mr. Doran’s</char> house that morning.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and
your relations to her.</quote></p><p>Lord <action><char gender = "male" name = "robertstSimon">St. Simon</char> shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows</action>. <quote speaker = "robertstSimon">We have
been on a friendly footing for some years—I may say on a _very_
friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have not treated her
ungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but
you know what women are, Mr. <char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char>. Flora was a dear little thing, but
exceedingly hot-headed and devotedly attached to me. <action><char gender = "female" name = "floraMillar">She</char> wrote me
dreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married</action>, and, to
tell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly
was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came
to <char gender = "male" name = "aloysiusDoran">Mr. Doran’s</char> door just after we returned, and <action><char gender = "female" name = "floraMillar">she</char> endeavoured to push
her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even
threatening her</action>, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the
sort, and I had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon
pushed her out again. <action><char gender = "female" name = "floraMillar">She</char> was quiet when she saw that there was no good
in making a row.</action></quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">Did your wife hear all this?</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "robertstSimon">No, thank goodness, she did not.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "robertstSimon">Yes.

given you all the facts.</action> Since you ask me, however, I may say that it
has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the
consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the
effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "robertstSimon">Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back—I will not

    father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor <char gender = "male" name = "francisMoulton">Frank</char> here had
a claim that petered out and came to nothing. The richer Pa grew the
poorer was <char gender = "male" name = "francisMoulton">Frank</char>; so at last Pa wouldn’t hear of our engagement lasting
    any longer, and he took me away to ’Frisco. <char gender = "male" name = "francisMoulton">Frank</char> wouldn’t throw up his
    hand, though; so <action><char gender = "male" name = "francisMoulton">he</char> followed me there, and he saw me without Pa knowing

fixed it all up for ourselves. <char gender = "male" name = "francisMoulton">Frank</char> said that he would go and make his
pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as Pa.

thought I had a decline and took me to half the doctors in ’Frisco. Not

question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to
see him. I wonder I didn’t drop. I know that everything was turning
round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee
in my ear. I didn’t know what to do. Should I stop the service and make
a scene in the church? <action><char gender = "female" name = "hattyDoran">I</char> glanced at him again</action>, and he seemed to know

returned me the flowers</action>. It was only a line asking me to join him when

he might direct.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "hattyDoran">When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and

Lord <char gender = "male" name = "robertstSimon">St. Simon</char>, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all
    those great people. <action><char gender = "female" name = "hattyDoran">I</char> just made up my mind to run away and explain
afterwards</action>. I hadn’t been at the table ten minutes before I saw <char gender = "male" name = "francisMoulton">Frank</char>
    out of the window at the other side of the road. <action><char gender = "male" name = "francisMoulton">He</char> beckoned to me and
        then began walking into the Park</action>. <action><char gender = "female" name = "hattyDoran">I</char> slipped out, put on my things, and
followed him</action>. Some woman came talking something or other about <char gender = "male" name = "robertstSimon">Lord St.
Simon</char> to me—seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little
secret of his own before marriage also—but I managed to get away from
her and soon overtook <char gender = "male" name = "francisMoulton">Frank</char>. We got into a cab together, and away we
drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my
true wedding after all those years of waiting. <action><char gender = "male" name = "francisMoulton">Frank</char> had been a
prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to ’Frisco, found that
I had given him up for dead and had gone to England, followed me there,
and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding</action>.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "Frank"><action><char gender = "male" name = "francisMoulton">I</char> saw it in a paper</action>,</quote> explained the American. <quote speaker = "Frank">It gave the name and
the church but not where the lady lived.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "hattyDoran">Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and <char gender = "male" name = "francisMoulton">Frank</char> was all for
openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should
like to vanish away and never see any of them again—just sending a line
to Pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful to me to
think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table
and waiting for me to come back. So <action><char gender = "male" name = "francisMoulton">Frank</char> took my wedding-clothes and
things and made a bundle of them</action>, so that I should not be traced, and
dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely
that we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good
gentleman, Mr. <action><char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char>, came round to us this evening, though how he
found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly and
kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right</action>, and that we should be
    putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. Then <action><char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">he</char> offered to
give us a chance of talking</action> to Lord <char gender = "male" name = "robertstSimon">St. Simon</char> alone, and so we came
    right away round to his rooms at once. Now, <char gender = "male" name = "robertstSimon">Robert</char>, you have heard it
all, and I am very sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope that you
do not think very meanly of me.</quote></p><p>Lord <action><char gender = "male" name = "robertstSimon">St. Simon</char> had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had
listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long
narrative</action>.</p><p><quote speaker = "robertstSimon">Excuse me,</quote> he said, <quote speaker = "robertstSimon">but it is not my custom to discuss my most
    intimate personal affairs in this public manner.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "hattyDoran">Then you won’t forgive me? You won’t shake hands before I go?</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "robertstSimon">Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.</quote> <action><char gender = "male" name = "robertstSimon">He</char> put out his hand
and coldly grasped that which she extended to him</action>.</p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">I had hoped,</quote> suggested <char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char>, <quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">that you would have joined us in a
friendly supper.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "robertstSimon">I think that there you ask a little too much,</quote> responded his Lordship.
<quote speaker = "robertstSimon">I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can
hardly be expected to make merry over them. I think that with your
permission I will now wish you all a very good-night.</quote> <action><char gender = "male" name = "robertstSimon">He</char> included us
all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.</action></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your company,</quote> said
Sherlock <char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char>. <quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">It is always a joy to meet an American, <char gender = "male" name = "francisMoulton">Mr. Moulton</char>,
for I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the
blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our
children from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country
under a flag which shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the
Stars and Stripes.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">The case has been an interesting one,</quote> remarked <char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char> when our
visitors had left us, <quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">because it serves to show very clearly how
simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems
to be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than the
sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than
the result when viewed, for instance, by <char gender = "male" name = "detectiveLestrade">Mr. Lestrade</char> of Scotland
Yard.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "johnWatson">You were not yourself at fault at all, then?</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the
lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other
that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home.
Obviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her
to change her mind. What could that something be? She could not have
spoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in the company of
the bridegroom. Had she seen someone, then? If she had, it must be
someone from America because she had spent so short a time in this
country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an
influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to
change her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a
process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an American.
Then who could this American be, and why should he possess so much
influence over her? It might be a lover; it might be a husband. Her
young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes and under
strange conditions. So far I had got before I ever heard <char gender = "male" name = "robertstSimon">Lord St.
    Simon’s</char> narrative. When he told us of a man in a pew, of the change in
the bride’s manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as
the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and
of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping—which in miners’
parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a
prior claim to—the whole situation became absolutely clear. <action><char gender = "female" name = "hattyDoran">She</char> had
gone off with a man</action>, and the man was either a lover or was a previous
    husband—the chances being in favour of the latter.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "johnWatson">And how in the world did you find them?</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">It might have been difficult, but friend <action><char gender = "male" name = "detectiveLestrade">Lestrade</char> held information in
his hands the value of which he did not himself know</action>. The initials
were, of course, of the highest importance, but more valuable still was
it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the
most select London hotels.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "johnWatson">How did you deduce the select?</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a
glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. There are
not many in London which charge at that rate. In the second one which I
visited in Northumberland Avenue, <action><char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">I</char> learned by an inspection of the
book</action> that <char gender = "male" name = "francisMoulton">Francis H. Moulton</char>, an American gentleman, had left only the
    day before, and on looking over the entries against him, <action><char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">I</char> came upon
the very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill</action>. His letters were
    to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so <action>thither <char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">I</char> travelled</action>, and being
    fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home, <action><char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">I</char> ventured to give
them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be
better in every way that they should make their position a little
clearer</action> both to the general public and to Lord <char gender = "male" name = "robertstSimon">St. Simon</char> in particular.
    <action><char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">I</char> invited them to meet him here</action>, and, as you see, <action><char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">I</char> made him keep the
appointment</action>.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "johnWatson">But with no very good result,</quote> I remarked. <quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">His conduct was certainly
not very gracious.</quote></p><p><quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">Ah, <char gender = "male" name = "johnWatson">Watson</char>,</quote> said <action><char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char>, smiling</action>, <quote speaker = "sherlockHolmes">perhaps you would not be very
gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you
found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune. I think
that we may judge Lord <char gender = "male" name = "robertstSimon">St. Simon</char> very mercifully and thank our stars
that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position. Draw
your chair up and hand me my violin, for the only problem we have still
to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings.</quote></p>
