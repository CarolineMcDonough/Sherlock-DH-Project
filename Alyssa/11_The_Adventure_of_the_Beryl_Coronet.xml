                                        >Holmes</char>,</quote> said I as <action><char gender = "male" name = "johnWatson">I</char> stood one morning in our
                        bow-window looking down the street</action>, <quote speaker="johnWatson">here is a
                                madman coming along. It seems rather sad that his relatives should
                                allow him to come out alone.</quote></p>
                <p><action><char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">My friend</char> rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pockets
                        of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder</action>. It was a bright, crisp
                        February morning, and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the
                        ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down the centre of Baker
                        Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at
                        either side and on the heaped-up edges of the footpaths it still lay as
                        white as when it fell. The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but
                        was still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer passengers than
                        usual. Indeed, from the direction of the Metropolitan Station no one was
                        coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my
                        attention.</p>
                <p>He was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a massive, strongly
                        marked face and a commanding figure. He was dressed in a sombre yet rich
                        style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut
                        pearl-grey trousers. Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity
                        of his dress and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little
                        springs, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax
                        upon his legs. <action>As <char gender = "male" name = "alexanderHolder">he</char> ran he jerked his hands up and down, waggled his head,
                        and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions.</action></p>
                <p><quote speaker="johnWatson">What on earth can be the matter with him?</quote> I
                        asked. <quote speaker="johnWatson"><action><char gender = "male" name = "alexanderHolder">He</char> is looking up at the numbers of the
                                houses.</action></quote></p>
                <p><quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">I believe that he is coming here,</quote> said
                                        <action><char gender="male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char>, rubbing his
                                hands</action>.</p>
                <p><quote speaker="johnWatson">Here?</quote></p>
                <p><quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me
                                professionally. I think that I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not
                                tell you?</quote> <action>As <char gender = "male" name = "alexanderHolder">he</char> spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed
                        at our door and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the
                        clanging.</action></p>
                <p>A few moments later <action><char gender = "male" name = "alexanderHolder">he</char> was in our room, still puffing, still gesticulating</action>, but
                        with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were
                        turned in an instant to horror and pity. For a while <action><char gender = "male" name = "alexanderHolder">he</char> could not get his
                        words out, but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been
                        driven to the extreme limits of his reason</action>. Then, <action>suddenly springing to his
                                feet, <char gender = "male" name = "alexanderHolder">he</char> beat his head against the wall with such force</action> that <action><char gender = "male" name = "johnWatson, sherlockHolmes">we both</char> rushed
                        upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room</action>. Sherlock <action><char
                                        gender="male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char> pushed him down into the
                                easy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted his hand and chatted with
                                him in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to
                                employ</action>.</p>
                <p><quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">You have come to me to tell your story, have you

                                problem which you may submit to me.</quote></p>
                <p><action><char gender = "male" name = "alexanderHolder">The man</char> sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against his
                        emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his lips tight,
                        and turned his face towards us.</action></p>
                <p><quote speaker="alexanderHolder">No doubt you think me mad?</quote> said he.</p>

                <p><quote speaker="alexanderHolder">God knows I have!â€”a trouble which is enough to
                                unseat my reason, so sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I
                                might have faced, although I am a man whose character has never yet
                                borne a stain. Private affliction also is the lot of every man; but
                                the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have been
                                enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone. The very
                                noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this
                                horrible affair.</quote></p>

                                firm of Holder &amp; Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street.</quote></p>
                <p>The name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the
                        second largest private banking concern in the City of London. What could
                        have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens of London to this
                        most pitiable pass? <action><char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes, johnWatson">We</char> waited, all curiosity</action>, until with another effort he
                        braced himself to tell his story.</p>
                <p><quote speaker="alexanderHolder">I feel that time is of value,</quote> said he;
                                <quote speaker="alexanderHolder">that is why I hastened here when
                                the police inspector suggested that I should secure your
                                co-operation. <action><char gender = "male" name = "alexanderHolder">I</char> came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried
                                from there on foot</action>, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That
                                is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little
                                exercise. <action><char gender = "male" name = "alexanderHolder">I</char> feel better now, and I will put the facts before you as

                <p><quote speaker="alexanderHolder">It is, of course, well known to you that in a
                                successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to
                                find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing
                                our connection and the number of our depositors. One of our most
                                lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans, where
                                the security is unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in this
                                direction during the last few years, and there are many noble
                                families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of
                                their pictures, libraries, or plate.</quote></p>

                                was a name which is a household word all over the earthâ€”one of the

                                plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to

                                        prefer to make it a matter of business and to carry out that

                                case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is involved
                                by your theory. You suppose that your son came down from his bed,
                                went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau, took
                                out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it,
                                went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the
                                thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then
                                returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed
                                himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now,
                                is such a theory tenable?</quote></p>

                        appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I

                        judgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he

                        appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had
                        been presented to him, and <action><char gender = "male" name = "alexanderHolder">he</char> even broke into a desultory chat with me over
                        his business affairs</action>. A short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us
                        to Fairbank, the modest residence of the great financier.</p>
                <p>Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a little
                        from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn, stretched
                        down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance. On the
                        right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path between
                        two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming
                        the tradesmenâ€™s entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the stables,
                        and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a public, though little
                        used, thoroughfare. <action><char gender="male" name="sherlockHolmes"
                                        >Holmes</char> left us standing at the door and walked
                                slowly all round the house, across the front, down the tradesmenâ€™s
                                path, and so round by the garden behind into the stable
                                lane</action>. So long was he that <char gender="male" name = "alexanderHolder">Mr.
                                Holder</char> and I went into the dining-room and waited by the fire
                        until he should return. <action><char gender = "male" name = "alexanderHolder, johnWatson">We</char> were sitting there in silence</action> when the door

                        paleness in a womanâ€™s face. Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were
                        flushed with crying. As <action><char gender = "female" name = "maryHolder">she</char> swept silently into the room</action> she impressed me
                        with a greater sense of grief than <char gender="male" name = "alexanderHolder">the banker</char> had
                        done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was
                        evidently a woman of strong character, with immense capacity for
                        self-restraint. <action>Disregarding my presence, <char gender = "female" name = "maryHolder">she</char> went straight to her uncle and

                                opinion as to what had occurred</action>. A man had waited outside the
                                window; someone had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by
                                your son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had
                                each tugged at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries
                                which neither alone could have effected. <action><char gender = "male" name = "arthurHolder">He</char> had returned with the
                                prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent</action>. So far
                                I was clear. The question now was, who was the man and who was it
                                brought him the coronet?</quote></p>
                <p><quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">It is an old maxim of mine that when you have
                                excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must
                                be the truth. Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it
                                down, so there only remained your niece and the maids. But if it
                                were the maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in
                                their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his
                                cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should
                                retain her secretâ€”the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one.
                                When <action><char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">I</char> remembered that you had seen her at that window, and how she
                                had fainted on seeing the coronet again</action>, my conjecture became a
                                certainty.</quote></p>

                                which she must feel to you? I knew that you went out little, and
                                that your circle of friends was a very limited one. But among them

                                a pistol to his head before he could strike</action>. Then he became a little
