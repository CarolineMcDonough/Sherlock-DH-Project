<h2>THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS</h2>
<p>When <span class="sw-action">I glance over my notes and records</span> of the Sherlock Holmes cases
   between the years ’82 and ’90, I am faced by so many which present
   strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know
   which to choose and which to leave. Some, however, have already gained
   publicity through the papers, and others have not offered a field for
   those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree,
   and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. Some, too,
   have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives,
   beginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially
   cleared up, and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture
   and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to
   him. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in
   its details and so startling in its results that <span class="sw-action"> I am tempted to give
      some account of it</span> in spite of the fact that there are points in
   connection with it which never have been, and probably never will be,
   entirely cleared up.</p>
<p>The year ’87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or
   less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my headings under
   this one twelve months I find an account of the adventure of the
   Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a luxurious
   club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the facts
   connected with the loss of the British barque Sophy Anderson, of the
   singular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and
   finally of the Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may be
   remembered,<span class="sw-action"> Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man’s
      watch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that
      therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time—a deduction
      which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case.</span> All these
   I may sketch out at some future date, but none of them present such
   singular features as the strange train of circumstances which <span class="sw-action">I have
      now taken up my pen to describe</span>.</p>
<p>It was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales had
   set in with exceptional violence. All day the wind had screamed and the
   rain had beaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart of
   great, hand-made London we were forced to raise our minds for the
   instant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those
   great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his
   civilisation, like untamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in, the
   storm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a
   child in the chimney. <span class="sw-action">Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the
      fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime</span>, while <span class="sw-action">I at the other was
      deep in one of Clark Russell’s fine sea-stories </span>until the howl of the
   gale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of the
   rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves.<span class="female female" title="maryWatson mrsMorston">My wife was
      on a visit to her mother’s</span>, and for a few days I was a dweller once
   more in my old quarters at Baker Street.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“Why,”</q> said I, glancing up at my companion, <q class="sw-quote">“that was surely the bell.
      Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“Except yourself I have none,”</q> he answered. <q class="sw-quote">“I do not encourage
      visitors.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“A client, then?”</q></p>
<p><q class="female-quote">“If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out on
      such a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more likely to
      be some crony of the landlady’s.”</q></p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a
   step in the passage and a tapping at the door. <span class="sw-action"> He stretched out his
      long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant
      chair upon which a newcomer must sit.</span></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“Come in!”</q> said he.</p>
<p>The man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside,
   well-groomed and trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy
   in his bearing. The streaming umbrella which he held in his hand, and
   his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he
   had come. <span class="male" title="johnOpenshaw">He looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I
      could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a
      man who is weighed down with some great anxiety.</span></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">“I owe you an apology,”</q> he said, <span class="male" title="johnOpenshaw"> raising his golden pince-nez to his
      eyes</span>. <q class="male-quote">“I trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have brought some
      traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“Give me your coat and umbrella,”</q> said Holmes. <q class="sw-quote">“They may rest here on
      the hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from the
      south-west, I see.”</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">“Yes, from Horsham.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is quite
      distinctive.”</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">“I have come for advice.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“That is easily got.”</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">“And help.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“That is not always so easy.”</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">“I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast how
      you saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.”</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">“He said that <span class="" title="">you could solve anything</span>.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“He said too much.”</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">“That you are never beaten.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“I have <span class="male" title="u_men"> been beaten four times—three times by men</span>, 
      and once <span class="female" title="u_woman">by a woman</span>.”</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">“But what is that compared with the number of your successes?”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“It is true that I have been generally successful.”</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">“Then you may be so with me.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with
      some details as to your case.”</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">“It is no ordinary one.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“None of those which come to me are. I am the last court of appeal.”</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">“And yet <span class="male" title="johnOpenshaw">I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you have
         ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events
         than those which have happened in my own family</span>.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“You fill me with interest,”</q> said Holmes. <q class="sw-quote">“Pray give us the essential
      facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to
      those details which seem to me to be most important.”</q></p>
<p><span class="male" title="johnOpenshaw">The young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards
      the blaze.</span></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">“‘They may do what they like, but I’ll checkmate them still,’</q> said he
   with an oath. <q class="male-quote">‘Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room to-day,
      and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.’</q></p>
<p>“Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse
   your patience, there came a night when <span class="male" title="eliasOpenshaw"> he made one of those drunken
      sallies from which he never came back</span>. We found him, when we went to
   search for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay
   at the foot of the garden. There was no sign of any violence, and the
   water was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his
   known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of ‘suicide.’ But I, who knew
   how <span class="male" title="eliasOpenshaw"> he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade
      myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. </span>The matter passed,
   however, and my <span class="male" title="josephOpenshaw"> father entered into possession of the estate, and of
      some £ 14,000, which lay to his credit at the bank</span>.”</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“One moment,”</q> Holmes interposed, <q class="sw-quote">“your statement is, I foresee, one of
      the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me have the date
      of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of <span class="male" title="eliasOpenshaw"> his
         supposed suicide</span>.”</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">“The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks later,
      upon the night of May 2nd.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“Thank you. Pray proceed.”</q></p>
<p>“Well, it was the beginning of ’84 when <span class="male" title="josephOpenshaw">cmy father came to live at
      Horsham</span>, and all went as well as possible with us until the January of
   ’85. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a
   sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table. There
   he was, sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried
   orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one. <span class="male" title="josephOpenshaw"> He had always
      laughed at what he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but
      he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon
      himself</span>.
   
   
   <p><q class="male-quote">“‘Why, what on earth does this mean, John?’</q> he stammered.</p>
   
   
   <p><q class="male-quote">“My heart had turned to lead. ‘It is K. K. K.,’</q> said I.</p>
   
   
   <p><q class="male-quote">“He looked inside the envelope. ‘So it is,’ he cried. ‘Here are the
         very letters. But what is this written above them?’</q></p>
   
   
   <p><q class="male-quote">“‘Put the papers on the sundial,’</q> I read, peeping over his shoulder.</p>
   
   
   <p><q class="male-quote">“‘What papers? What sundial?’</q> he asked.</p>
   
   
   <p><q class="male-quote">“‘The sundial in the garden. There is no other,’</q> said I; <q class="sw-quote">‘but the
         papers must be those that are destroyed.’</q></p>
   
   
   <p><q class="male-quote">“‘Pooh!’</q> said he, gripping hard at his courage. <q class="sw-quote">‘We are in a civilised
         land here, and we can’t have tomfoolery of this kind. Where does the
         thing come from?’</q></p>
   
   
   <p><q class="male-quote">“‘From Dundee,’</q> I answered, glancing at the postmark.</p>
   
   
   <p><q class="male-quote">“‘Some preposterous practical joke,’</q> said he. <q class="sw-quote">‘What have I to do with
         sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such nonsense.’</q></p>
   
   
   <p><q class="male-quote">“‘I should certainly speak to the police,’</q> I said.</p>
   
   
   <p><q class="male-quote">“‘And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.’</q></p>
   
   
   <p><q class="male-quote">“‘Then let me do so?’</q></p>
   
   
   <p><q class="male-quote">“‘No, I forbid you. I won’t have a fuss made about such nonsense.’</q></p>
   
   
   <p>“It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man. <span class="male" title="johnOpenshaw"> I
         went about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings</span>.</p>
   
   
   <p>“On the third day after the coming of the letter<span class="male" title="josephOpenshaw"> my father went from
         home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in command
         of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill</span>. I was glad that he should go,
      for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away
      from home. In that, however, I was in error. Upon the second day of his
      absence I received a telegram from the major, imploring me to come at
      once. <span class="male" title="josephOpenshaw">My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound
         in the neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull.
         I hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered his
         consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from Fareham in
         the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit
         unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of ‘death
         from accidental causes.’ </span>Carefully as I examined every fact connected
      with his death, I was unable to find anything which could suggest the
      idea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no
      robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads. And
      yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that I
      was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.</p>
   
   “In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me why I
   did not dispose of it? I answer, because <span class="male male" title="johnOpenshaw eliasOpenshaw">I was well convinced that our
      troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle’s
      life, and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in
      another</span>.</p>
<p><q class="male-quote">“‘Why, what on earth does this mean, John?’</q> he stammered.</p>
<p><q class="male-quote">“My heart had turned to lead. ‘It is K. K. K.,’</q> said I.</p>

   yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that I
   was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.</p>
<p><span class="male" title="johnOpenshaw"> The young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and turning
      to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.</span></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">“This is the envelope,”</q> he continued. <q class="male-quote">“The postmark is London—eastern
      division. Within are the very words which were upon my father’s last
      message: ‘K. K. K.’; and then ‘Put the papers on the sundial.’”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“What have you done?”</q> asked Holmes.</p>
<p><q class="male-quote">“Nothing.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“Nothing?”</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">“To tell the truth”</q><span class="male" title="johnOpenshaw"> he sank his face into his thin, white hands</span>—<q class="male-quote">“I have
      felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the
      snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the grasp of some
      resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can
      guard against.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“Tut! tut!”</q> cried Sherlock Holmes. <q class="sw-quote">“You must act, man, or you are lost.
      Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for despair.”</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">“I have seen the police.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“Ah!”</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">“But they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that the
      inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical
      jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as
      the jury stated, and were not to be connected with the warnings.”</q></p>
<p><span class="sw-action"> Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air</span>. <q class="sw-quote">“Incredible imbecility!”</q> he
   cried.</p>
<p><q class="male-quote">“They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the
      house with me.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“Has he come with you to-night?”</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">“No. His orders were to stay in the house.”</q></p>
<p><span class="sw-action"> Again Holmes raved in the air.</span></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“Why did you come to me?”</q> he said, <q class="sw-quote">“and, above all, why did you not
      come at once?”</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">“I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast
      about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“It is really two days since you had the letter. We should have acted
      before this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than that which
      you have placed before us—no suggestive detail which might help us?”</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">“There is one thing,”</q> said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat
   pocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he
   laid it out upon the table. <q class="male-quote">“I have some remembrance,”</q> said he, <q class="male-quote">“that
      on the day when my <span class="male" title="eliasOpenshaw">uncle burned the papers </span>I observed that the small,
      unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular
      colour. I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am
      inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps,
      fluttered out from among the others, and in that way has escaped
      destruction. Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us
      much. I think myself that it is a page from some private diary. The
      writing is undoubtedly my uncle’s.”</q></p>
<p><span class="sw-action"> Holmes moved the lamp</span>, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which
   showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. It
   was headed, “March, 1869,” and beneath were the following enigmatical
   notices:</p>
<p>“4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.
   
   “7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and John Swain of St.
   Augustine.
   
   “9th. McCauley cleared.
   
   “10th. John Swain cleared.
   
   “12th. Visited Paramore. All well.”</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“Thank you!”</q> said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it to our
   visitor. <q class="sw-quote">“And now you must on no account lose another instant. We
      cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me. You must get
      home instantly and act.”</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">“What shall I do?”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must put
      this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which
      you have described. You must also put in a note to say that all the
      other papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only one
      which remains. You must assert that in such words as will carry
      conviction with them. Having done this, you must at once put the box
      out upon the sundial, as directed. Do you understand?”</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">“Entirely.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I think
      that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to
      weave, while theirs is already woven. The first consideration is to
      remove the pressing danger which threatens you. The second is to clear
      up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties.”</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">“I thank you,”</q> said the young man, rising and pulling on his overcoat.
   <q class="male-quote">“You have given me fresh life and hope. I shall certainly do as you
      advise.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in the
      meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are
      threatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you go back?”</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">“By train from Waterloo.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“It is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that you
      may be in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely.”</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">“<span class="male" title="johnOpenshaw"> I am armed</span>.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“That is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.”</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">“I shall see you at Horsham, then?”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“No, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek it.”</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">“<span class="male" title="johnOpenshaw">Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to
         the box and the papers. I shall take your advice in every particular</span>.”</q>
   He shook hands with us and took his leave. Outside the wind still
   screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows. This
   strange, wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad
   elements—blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a gale—and now to
   have been reabsorbed by them once more.</p>
<p><span class="sw-action">Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk
      forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he lit
      his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings
      as they chased each other up to the ceiling.</span></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“I think, Watson,”</q> he remarked at last, <q class="sw-quote">“that of all our cases we have
      had none more fantastic than this.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems to me
      to be walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“But have you,”</q> I asked, <q class="sw-quote">“formed any definite conception as to what
      these perils are?”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“There can be no question as to their nature,”</q> he answered.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does <span class="male" title="u_suspect"> he pursue this
         unhappy family?”</span></q></p>
<p><span class="sw-action"> Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of
      his chair, with his finger-tips together</span>. <q class="sw-quote">“The ideal reasoner,”</q> he
   remarked, <q class="sw-quote">“would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its
      bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up
      to it but also all the results which would follow from it. As Cuvier
      could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a
      single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in
      a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other
      ones, both before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which
      the reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study
      which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of
      their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is
      necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts
      which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you
      will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these
      days of free education and encyclopædias, is a somewhat rare
      accomplishment. It is not so impossible, however, that a man should
      possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work,
      and this I have endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly,
      you on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my
      limits in a very precise fashion.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“Yes,”</q> I answered, laughing. <q class="sw-quote">“It was a singular document. Philosophy,
      astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember. Botany
      variable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region
      within fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic,
      sensational literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer,
      swordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I
      think, were the main points of my analysis.”</q></p>
<p>Holmes grinned at the last item. <q class="sw-quote">“Well,” he said, “I say now, as I said
      then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all
      the furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in
      the lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants it.
      Now, for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us
      to-night, we need certainly to muster all our resources. Kindly hand me
      down the letter K of the American Encyclopedia which stands upon the
      shelf beside you. Thank you. Now let us consider the situation and see
      what may be deduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a
      strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason
      for leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all their
      habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for the
      lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love of solitude
      in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or
      something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of
      someone or something which drove him from America. As to what it was he
      feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters
      which were received by himself and his successors. Did you remark the
      postmarks of those letters?”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third
      from London.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“From East London. What do you deduce from that?”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that the
      probability—the strong probability—is that the writer was on board of a
      ship. And now let us consider another point. In the case of
      Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment,
      in Dundee it was only some three or four days. Does that suggest
      anything?”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“A greater distance to travel.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“But the letter had also a greater distance to come.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“Then I do not see the point.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or
      men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send their
      singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission.
      You see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from
      Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would have
      arrived almost as soon as their letter. But, as a matter of fact, seven
      weeks elapsed. I think that those seven weeks represented the
      difference between the mail-boat which brought the letter and the
      sailing vessel which brought the writer.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“It is possible.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly urgency of
      this new case, and why <span class="sw-action"> I urged young Openshaw to caution</span>. The blow has
      always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to
      travel the distance. But this one comes from London, and therefore we
      cannot count upon delay.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“Good God!” I cried. “What can it mean, this relentless persecution?”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to
      the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite
      clear that there must be more than one of them. A single man could not
      have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner’s
      jury. There must have been several in it, and they must have been men
      of resource and determination. Their papers they mean to have, be the
      holder of them who it may. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be
      the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“But of what society?”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“Have you never—” said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking his
      voice—“have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“I never have.”</q></p>
<p><span class="" title="">Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee</span>. <q class="sw-quote">“Here it is,”</q>
   said he presently:</p>
<p>“‘Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the
   sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret society was
   formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the
   Civil War, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of
   the country, notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia,
   and Florida. Its power was used for political purposes, principally for
   the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from
   the country of those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were
   usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic
   but generally recognised shape—a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts,
   melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving this the victim
   might either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from the
   country. If he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon
   him, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was
   the organisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that
   there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving
   it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to
   the perpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite
   of the efforts of the United States government and of the better
   classes of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year 1869,
   the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been
   sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.’</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“You will observe,”</q> said Holmes, laying down the volume, <q class="sw-quote">“that the
      sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance
      of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may well have been cause
      and effect. It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the
      more implacable spirits upon their track. You can understand that this
      register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South,
      and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is
      recovered.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“Then the page we have seen—”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, ‘sent the
      pips to A, B, and C’—that is, sent the society’s warning to them. Then
      there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or left the country,
      and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C.
      Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place,
      and I believe that the only chance young Openshaw has in the meantime
      is to do what I have told him. There is nothing more to be said or to
      be done to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget
      for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable
      ways of our fellow men.”</q></p>
<p>It had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued
   brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city.
   <span class="sw-action"> Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came down</span>.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“You will excuse me for not waiting for you,”</q> said he; <q class="sw-quote">“I have, I
      foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young
      Openshaw’s.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“What steps will you take?”</q> I asked.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries. I may
      have to go down to Horsham, after all.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“You will not go there first?”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“No, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and the maid
      will bring up your coffee.”</q></p>
<p><span class="" title="">As I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced
      my eye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my
      heart.</span></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“Holmes,”</q> I cried, <q class="sw-quote">“you are too late.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“Ah!”</q> said he, laying down his cup, <q class="sw-quote">“I feared as much. How was it
      done?”</q> He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“<span class="sw-action"> My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading ‘Tragedy Near
         Waterloo Bridge</span></q>.’ Here is the account:</p>
<p>“‘Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H
   Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and a
   splash in the water. The night, however, was extremely dark and stormy,
   so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it was quite
   impossible to effect a rescue. The alarm, however, was given, and, by
   the aid of the water-police, the body was eventually recovered. It
   proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name, as it appears from
   an envelope which was found in his pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose
   residence is near Horsham. It is conjectured that <span class="male" title="johnOpenshaw"> he may have been
      hurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo Station, and that
      in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked
      over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats</span>.
   The body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt
   that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident, which
   should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to
   the condition of the riverside landing-stages.’”</p>
<p>We sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken
   than I had ever seen him.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“That hurts my pride, Watson,”</q> he said at last. <q class="sw-quote">“It is a petty feeling,
      no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal matter with me
      now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this gang.
      That he should come to me for help, and <span class="sw-action">that I should send him away to
         his death—</span>!”</q> <span class="sw-action"> He sprang from his chair and paced about the room in
      uncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a
      nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands</span>.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“They must be cunning devils,”</q> he exclaimed at last. <q class="sw-quote">“How could they
      have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the direct line
      to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a
      night, for their purpose. Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in
      the long run. I am going out now!”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“To the police?”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“No; &gt;I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may take
      the flies, but not before.”</q></p>
<p>All day <span class="" title="">I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in the
      evening before I returned to Baker Street</span>. Sherlock Holmes had not come
   back yet. It was nearly ten o’clock before <span class="sw-action"> he entered, looking pale and
      worn. He walked up to the sideboard, and tearing a piece from the loaf
      he devoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught of
      water</span>.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“You are hungry,”</q> I remarked.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“Starving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since
      breakfast.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“Nothing?”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“Not a bite. I had no time to think of it.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“And how have you succeeded?”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“Well.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“You have a clue?”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“I have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not long
      remain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark
      upon them. It is well thought of!”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“What do you mean?”</q></p>
<p><span class="sw-action"> He took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he
      squeezed out the pips upon the table. Of these he took five and thrust
      them into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote “S. H. for J.
      O.” Then he sealed it and addressed it to “Captain James Calhoun,
      Barque Lone Star, Savannah, Georgia.”</span></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“That will await him when he enters port,”</q> said he, chuckling. <q class="sw-quote">“It may
      give him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a precursor of his
      fate as Openshaw did before him.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“And who is this Captain Calhoun?”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“How did you trace it, then?”</q></p>
<p><span class="" title="">He took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates
      and names</span>.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“I have spent the whole day,”</q> said he, <q class="sw-quote">“over Lloyd’s registers and
      files of the old papers, following the future career of every vessel
      which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in ’83. There were
      thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those
      months. Of these, one, the Lone Star, instantly attracted my
      attention, since, although it was reported as having cleared from
      London, the name is that which is given to one of the states of the
      Union.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“Texas, I think.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an
      American origin.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“What then?”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque Lone
      Star was there in January, ’85, my suspicion became a certainty. I
      then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of
      London.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“Yes?”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“The Lone Star had arrived here last week. I went down to the Albert
      Dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide
      this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired to Gravesend and
      learned that she had passed some time ago, and as the wind is easterly
      I have no doubt that she is now past the Goodwins and not very far from
      the Isle of Wight.”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“What will you do, then?”</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">“Oh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I learn, the
      only native-born Americans in the ship. The others are Finns and
      Germans. I know, also, that they were all three away from the ship last
      night. I had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo. By
      the time that their sailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will
      have carried this letter, and the cable will have informed the police
      of Savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a
      charge of murder.”</q></p>
<p>There is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and the
   murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which
   would show them that another, as cunning and as resolute as themselves,
   was upon their track. Very long and very severe were the equinoctial
   gales that year. We waited long for news of the Lone Star of
   Savannah, but none ever reached us. We did at last hear that somewhere
   far out in the Atlantic a shattered stern-post of a boat was seen
   swinging in the trough of a wave, with the letters “L. S.” carved upon
   it, and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the Lone
   Star.</p>
