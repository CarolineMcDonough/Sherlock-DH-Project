<h2>XI. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET</h2>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Holmes,</q> said I as <span class="sw-action">I stood one morning in our
      bow-window looking down the street</span>, <q class="sw-quote">here is a
      madman coming along. It seems rather sad that his relatives should
      allow him to come out alone.</q></p>
<p><span class="sw-action">My friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pockets
      of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder</span>. It was a bright, crisp
   February morning, and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the
   ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down the centre of Baker
   Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at
   either side and on the heaped-up edges of the footpaths it still lay as
   white as when it fell. The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but
   was still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer passengers than
   usual. Indeed, from the direction of the Metropolitan Station no one was
   coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my
   attention.</p>
<p>He was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a massive, strongly
   marked face and a commanding figure. He was dressed in a sombre yet rich
   style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut
   pearl-grey trousers. Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity
   of his dress and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little
   springs, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax
   upon his legs. <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">As he ran he jerked his hands up and down, waggled his head,
      and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions.</span></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">What on earth can be the matter with him?</q> I
   asked. <q class="sw-quote"><span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">He is looking up at the numbers of the
         houses.</span></q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">I believe that he is coming here,</q> said
   <span class="sw-action">Holmes, rubbing his
      hands</span>.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Here?</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me
      professionally. I think that I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not
      tell you?</q> <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">As he spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed
      at our door and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the
      clanging.</span></p>
<p>A few moments later <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">he was in our room, still puffing, still gesticulating</span>, but
   with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were
   turned in an instant to horror and pity. For a while <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">he could not get his
      words out, but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been
      driven to the extreme limits of his reason</span>. Then, <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">suddenly springing to his
      feet, he beat his head against the wall with such force</span> that <span class="male" title="johnWatson, sherlockHolmes">we both rushed
      upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room</span>. Sherlock <span class="sw-action">Holmes pushed him down into the
      easy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted his hand and chatted with
      him in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to
      employ</span>.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">You have come to me to tell your story, have you
      not?</q> said he. <q class="sw-quote">You are
      fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have recovered
      yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little
      problem which you may submit to me.</q></p>
<p><span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">The man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against his
      emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his lips tight,
      and turned his face towards us.</span></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">No doubt you think me mad?</q> said he.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">I see that you have had some great
      trouble,</q> responded Holmes.</p>
<p><q class="male-quote">God knows I have!—a trouble which is enough to
      unseat my reason, so sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I
      might have faced, although I am a man whose character has never yet
      borne a stain. Private affliction also is the lot of every man; but
      the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have been
      enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone. The very
      noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this
      horrible affair.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Pray compose yourself, sir,</q> said Holmes, <q class="sw-quote">and let
      me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has
      befallen you.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">My name,</q> answered our visitor, <q class="male-quote">is probably familiar to your ears. I am
      Alexander Holder, of the banking
      firm of Holder &amp; Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street.</q></p>
<p>The name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the
   second largest private banking concern in the City of London. What could
   have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens of London to this
   most pitiable pass? <span class="sw-action">We waited, all curiosity</span>, until with another effort he
   braced himself to tell his story.</p>
<p><q class="male-quote">I feel that time is of value,</q> said he;
   <q class="male-quote">that is why I hastened here when
      the police inspector suggested that I should secure your
      co-operation. <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried
         from there on foot</span>, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That
      is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little
      exercise. <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">I feel better now, and I will put the facts before you as
         shortly and yet as clearly as I can</span>.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">It is, of course, well known to you that in a
      successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to
      find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing
      our connection and the number of our depositors. One of our most
      lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans, where
      the security is unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in this
      direction during the last few years, and there are many noble
      families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of
      their pictures, libraries, or plate.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Yesterday morning <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">I was seated in my office at
         the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks. </span>I
      started when I saw the name, for it was that of none other
      than—well, perhaps even to you I had better say no more than that it
      was a name which is a household word all over the earth—one of the
      highest, noblest, most exalted names in England. <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">I was overwhelmed
         by the honour and attempted, when he entered</span>, to say so, but <span class="male" title="Clerk">he
         plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to
         hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.</span></q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">Mr.
         Holder,</q><br/> said he, <q class="male-quote">I have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing
         money.</q></q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">The firm does so
         when the security is good.</q> I answered.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">It is absolutely essential
         to me,</q><br/> said he, <q class="male-quote">that I should
         have £ 50,000 at once. I could, of course, borrow so
         trifling a sum ten times over from my friends, but I much
         prefer to make it a matter of business and to carry out that
         business myself. In my position you can readily understand
         that it is unwise to place one’s self under
         obligations.</q></q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">For how long,
         may I ask, do you want this sum?</q> I asked.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">Next Monday I have a large
         sum due to me, and I shall then most certainly repay what
         you advance, with whatever interest you think it right to
         charge. But it is very essential to me that the money should
         be paid at once.</q></q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">I should be
         happy to advance it without further parley from my own
         private purse,</q><br/> said I, <q class="male-quote"> were it not that the strain would
         be rather more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I
         am to do it in the name of the firm, then in justice to my
         partner I must insist that, even in your case, every
         businesslike precaution should be taken.</q></q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">I should much prefer to
         have it so,</q><br/> said he, raising up a square, black
      morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. <q class="male-quote">You have doubtless heard of the Beryl
         Coronet?</q></q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">One of the most
         precious public possessions of the empire,</q> said
      I.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">Precisely.</q><br/> <span class="male" title="Clerk">He
         opened the case</span>, and there, imbedded in soft, flesh-coloured velvet,
      lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named. <q class="male-quote">There are thirty-nine enormous
         beryls,</q><br/> said he, <q class="male-quote">and the price
         of the gold chasing is incalculable. The lowest estimate
         would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I
         have asked. I am prepared to leave it with you as my
         security.</q></q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">I took the precious case into my hands and
         looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious
         client.</span></q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">You doubt its
         value?</q> he asked.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">Not at all. I
         only doubt—</q></q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">The propriety of my
         leaving it. You may set your mind at rest about that. I
         should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain
         that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a
         pure matter of form. Is the security
         sufficient?</q></q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">Ample.</q></q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">You understand, Mr. Holder, that <span class="male" title="Clerk">I am giving
            you a strong proof of the confidence which I have in you</span>,
         founded upon all that I have heard of you. I rely upon you
         not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip upon
         the matter but, above all, to preserve this coronet with
         every possible precaution because I need not say that a
         great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to
         befall it. Any injury to it would be almost as serious as
         its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the world to
         match these, and it would be impossible to replace them. <span class="male" title="Clerk">I
            leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and I
            shall call for it in person on Monday
            morning.</span></q></q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I
      said no more but, <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over
         fifty £ 1000 notes</span>. When I was alone once more, however, with the
      precious case lying upon the table in front of me, I could not but
      think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which it
      entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it was a national
      possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should
      occur to it. <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">I already regretted having ever consented to take
         charge of it</span>. However, it was too late to alter the matter now, so <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">I
         locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my
         work</span>.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">When evening came I felt that it would be an
      imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me.
      Bankers’ safes had been forced before now, and why should not mine
      be? If so, how terrible would be the position in which I should find
      myself! <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">I determined, therefore, that for the next few days I would
         always carry the case backward and forward with me</span>, so that it might
      never be really out of my reach. With this intention, <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">I called a cab
         and drove out to my house at Streatham, carrying the jewel with me.
         I did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs and locked it
         in the bureau of my dressing-room.</span></q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">I wish you to thoroughly
         understand the situation</span>. My groom and my page sleep out of the
      house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants
      who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute
      reliability is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second
      waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few months. <span class="female" title="lucyParr">She came
         with an excellent character</span>, however, and has always given me
      satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers
      who have occasionally hung about the place. That is the only
      drawback which we have found to her, but we believe her to be a
      thoroughly good girl in every way.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">So much for the servants. My family itself is so
      small that it will not take me long to describe it. I am a widower
      and have an only son, Arthur. He has been
      a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes—a
      grievous disappointment. I have no doubt that I am myself to blame.
      People tell me that <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">I have spoiled him.</span> Very likely I have. When my
      dear wife died <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">I felt that he was all I had to love</span>. I could not
      bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face. <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">I have
         never denied him a wish</span>. Perhaps it would have been better for both
      of us had I been sterner, but I meant it for the best.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">It was naturally my intention that he should
      succeed me in my business, but he was not of a business turn. He was
      wild, wayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the
      handling of large sums of money. When he was young <span class="male" title="arthurHolder">he became a
         member of an aristocratic club</span>, and there, having charming manners,
      he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and
      expensive habits. <span class="male" title="arthurHolder">He learned to play heavily at cards and to
         squander money on the turf</span>, until he had again and again to come to
      me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance, that he
      might settle his debts of honour. <span class="male" title="arthurHolder">He tried more than once to break
         away from the dangerous company</span> which he was keeping, but each time
      the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough to draw
      him back again.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man
      as Sir George Burnwell should gain an influence over him, for <span class="male" title="arthurHolder">he
         has frequently brought him to my house</span>, and <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">I have found myself that
         I could hardly resist the fascination of his manner</span>. He is older
      than Arthur, a man of the world to his
      finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a
      brilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. Yet when I
      think of him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his
      presence, I am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which
      I have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply
      distrusted. So I think, and so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a
      woman’s quick insight into character.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">And now there is only she to be described. She
      is my niece; but when my brother died five years ago and left her
      alone in the world <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever
         since as my daughter</span>. She is a sunbeam in my house—sweet, loving,
      beautiful, a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and
      quiet and gentle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I do not
      know what I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever
      gone against my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for
      he loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him. I think
      that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would
      have been she, and that his marriage might have changed his whole
      life; but now, alas! it is too late—forever too late!</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who
      live under my roof, and I shall continue with my miserable
      story.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room
      that night after dinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the
      precious treasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the
      name of my client. <span class="female" title="lucyParr">Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I
         am sure, left the room</span>; but I cannot swear that the door was closed.
      Mary and
      Arthur were
      much interested and wished to see the famous coronet, but I thought
      it better not to disturb it.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">Where have you put
         it?</q> asked 
      Arthur.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">In my own
         bureau.</q></q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">Well, I hope to goodness
         the house won’t be burgled during the night.</q> said
      he.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">It is locked
         up,</q> I answered.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">Oh, any old key will fit
         that bureau. When I was a youngster I have opened it myself
         with the key of the box-room cupboard.</q></q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">He often had a wild way of talking, so that I
      thought little of what he said. <span class="male" title="arthurHolder">He followed me to my room, however,
         that night with a very grave face</span>.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">Look here, dad,</q><br/>
      said he with his eyes cast down, <q class="male-quote">can you let
         me have £ 200?</q></q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">No, I
         cannot!</q><br/> I answered sharply. <q class="male-quote">I have been far too generous with
         you in money matters.</q></q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">You have been very
         kind,</q><br/> said he, <q class="male-quote">but I must have
         this money, or else I can never show my face inside the club
         again.</q></q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">And a very good
         thing, too!</q> I cried.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">Yes, but you would not
         have me leave it a dishonoured man,</q><br/> said he. <q class="male-quote">I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise
         the money in some way, and if you will not let me have it,
         then I must try other means.</q></q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">I was very angry, for this was the third demand
      during the month. <q class="male-quote">You shall not have
         a farthing from me,</q> I cried, on which <span class="male" title="arthurHolder">he bowed and
         left the room without another word</span>.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">When he was gone <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">I unlocked my bureau, made sure
         that my treasure was safe, and locked it again</span>. Then <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">I started to go
         round the house to see that all was secure—a duty</span> which I usually
      leave to Mary but
      which I thought it well to perform myself that night. As I came down
      the stairs I saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall, which
      <span class="female" title="maryHolder">she closed and fastened as I approached</span>.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="female-quote">Tell me,
         dad,</q><br/> said she, looking, I thought, a little
      disturbed, <q class="female-quote">did you give Lucy, the maid,
         leave to go out to-night?</q></q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">Certainly
         not.</q></q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="female-quote"><span class="female" title="lucyParr">She came in just
            now by the back door</span>. I have no doubt that she has only been
         to the side gate to see someone, but I think that it is
         hardly safe and should be stopped.</q></q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">You must speak
         to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer it. Are you
         sure that everything is fastened?</q></q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="female-quote">Quite sure,
         dad.</q></q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">Then,
         good-night.</q> <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">I kissed her and went up to my bedroom
         again</span>, where I was soon asleep.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr.
      Holmes, which may have any
      bearing upon the case, but <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">I beg that you will question me upon any
         point which I do not make clear</span>.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">On the contrary, your statement is singularly
      lucid.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">I come to a part of my story now in which I
         should wish to be particularly so</span>. I am not a very heavy sleeper,
      and the anxiety in my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so
      than usual. About two in the morning, then, <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">I was awakened by some
         sound in the house</span>. It had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had
      left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed
      somewhere. <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder"> lay listening with all my ears</span>. Suddenly, to my horror,
      there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next
      room. <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear, and peeped
         round the corner of my dressing-room door</span>.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">Arthur!</q><br/> I screamed, <q class="male-quote">you villain! you thief! How dare
         you touch that coronet?</q></q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my
      unhappy boy, dressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing
      beside the light, holding the coronet in his hands. <span class="male" title="arthurHolder">He appeared to
         be wrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength</span>. At my cry
      <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death</span>. <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">I snatched
         it up and examined it</span>. One of the gold corners, with three of the
      beryls in it, was missing.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">You
         blackguard!</q><br/> I shouted, beside myself with rage. <q class="male-quote">You have destroyed it! You have
         dishonoured me forever! Where are the jewels which you have
         stolen?</q></q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">Stolen!</q> he
      cried.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">Yes,
         thief!</q> I roared, shaking him by the
      shoulder.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">There are none missing.
         There cannot be any missing,</q> said he.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">There are three
         missing. And you know where they are. Must I call you a liar
         as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to tear off
         another piece?</q></q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">You have called me names
         enough,</q><br/> said he, <q class="male-quote">I will not
         stand it any longer. I shall not say another word about this
         business, since you have chosen to insult me. I will leave
         your house in the morning and make my own way in the
         world.</q></q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">You shall leave
         it in the hands of the police!</q><br/> I cried half-mad with
      grief and rage. <q class="male-quote">I shall have this
         matter probed to the bottom.</q></q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">You shall learn nothing
         from me,</q><br/> said he with a passion such as I should not
      have thought was in his nature. <q class="male-quote">If you choose
         to call the police, let the police find what they
         can.</q></q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">By this time the whole house was astir, for <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">I
         had raised my voice in my anger</span>. <span class="female" title="maryHolder">Mary was the first to
         rush into my room</span>, and, at the sight of the coronet
      and of Arthur’s
      face, <span class="female" title="maryHolder">she read the whole story and, with a scream, fell down
         senseless on the ground</span>. <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">I sent the housemaid for the police and put
         the investigation into their hands at once</span>. When the inspector and a
      constable entered the house, <span class="male" title="arthurHolder">
         Arthur, who had stood sullenly with his arms
         folded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge him
         with theft</span>. <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">I answered that it had ceased to be a
         private matter</span>, but had become a public one, since the ruined
      coronet was national property. I was determined that the law should
      have its way in everything.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">At least,</q><br/> said he,
      <q class="male-quote">you will not have me arrested at
         once. It would be to your advantage as well as mine if I
         might leave the house for five minutes.</q></q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">That you may get
         away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have
         stolen,</q> said I. And then, realising the dreadful
      position in which I was placed, <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">I implored him to remember that not
         only my honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at
         stake</span>; and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would
      convulse the nation. He might avert it all if he would but tell me
      what he had done with the three missing stones.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">You may as well
         face the matter,</q><br/> said I; <q class="male-quote">you have been caught in the act,
         and no confession could make your guilt more heinous. If you
         but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us
         where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and
         forgotten.</q></q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">Keep your forgiveness for
         those who ask for it,</q> <span class="male" title="arthurHolder">he answered, turning away from
         me with a sneer</span>. <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">I saw that he was too hardened for any words of
         mine to influence him</span>. There was but one way for it. <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">I called in the
         inspector and gave him into custody</span>. A search was made at once not
      only of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house
      where he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of
      them could be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for
      all our persuasions and our threats. This morning he was removed to
      a cell, and I, after going through all the police formalities, have
      hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling
      the matter. The police have openly confessed that they can at
      present make nothing of it. You may go to any expense which you
      think necessary. <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">I have already offered a reward of £ 1000</span>. My God,
      what shall I do! I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son in one
      night. Oh, what shall I do!</q></p>
<p><span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">He put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro, droning
      to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.</span></p>
<p>Sherlock <span class="sw-action">Holmes sat
      silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted and his eyes
      fixed upon the fire</span>.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Do you receive much company?</q> he
   asked.</p>
<p><q class="male-quote">None save my partner with his family and an
      occasional friend of Arthur’s. Sir George 
      Burnwell has been several times lately. No one else,
      I think.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Do you go out much in society?</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Arthur does. Mary and I
      stay at home. We neither of us care for it.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">That is unusual in a young girl.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">She is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not
      so very young. She is four-and-twenty.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">This matter, from what you say, seems to have
      been a shock to her also.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Terrible! She is even more affected than
      I.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">You have neither of you any doubt as to your
      son’s guilt?</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes
      with the coronet in his hands.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">I hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was
      the remainder of the coronet at all injured?</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Yes, it was twisted.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Do you not think, then, that he might have been
      trying to straighten it?</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">God bless you! You are doing what you can for
      him and for me. But it is too heavy a task. What was he doing there
      at all? If his purpose were innocent, why did he not say
      so?</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not
      invent a lie? His silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are
      several singular points about the case. What did the police think of
      the noise which awoke you from your sleep?</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">They considered that it might be caused by
      <span class="male" title="arthurHolder">Arthur’s closing
         his bedroom door.</span></q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would
      slam his door so as to wake a household. What did they say, then, of
      the disappearance of these gems?</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">They are still sounding the planking and probing
      the furniture in the hope of finding them.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Have they thought of looking outside the
      house?</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The
      whole garden has already been minutely examined.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Now, my dear sir,</q> said Holmes, <q class="sw-quote">is it not obvious to you now that this
      matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police
      were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a simple
      case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is involved
      by your theory. You suppose that your son came down from his bed,
      went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau, took
      out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it,
      went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the
      thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then
      returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed
      himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now,
      is such a theory tenable?</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">But what other is there?</q> cried the banker with a gesture of despair. <q class="male-quote">If his motives were innocent, why does he
      not explain them?</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">It is our task to find that out,</q> replied
   Holmes; <q class="sw-quote">so now, if you please, Mr. Holder, we
      will set off for Streatham together, and devote an hour to glancing
      a little more closely into details.</q></p>
<p><span class="sw-action">My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition</span>, which I was
   eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the
   story to which we had listened. I confess that the guilt of the banker’s son
   appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I
   had such faith in Holmes’
   judgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he
   was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation. <span class="sw-action">He hardly spoke a word the
      whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast
      and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought</span>. Our client
   appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had
   been presented to him, and <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">he even broke into a desultory chat with me over
      his business affairs</span>. A short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us
   to Fairbank, the modest residence of the great financier.</p>
<p>Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a little
   from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn, stretched
   down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance. On the
   right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path between
   two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming
   the tradesmen’s entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the stables,
   and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a public, though little
   used, thoroughfare. <span class="sw-action">Holmes left us standing at the door and walked
      slowly all round the house, across the front, down the tradesmen’s
      path, and so round by the garden behind into the stable
      lane</span>. So long was he that Mr.
   Holder and I went into the dining-room and waited by the fire
   until he should return. <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder, johnWatson">We were sitting there in silence</span> when the door
   opened and <span class="female" title="maryHolder">a young lady came in</span>. She was rather above the middle height,
   slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against the absolute
   pallor of her skin. I do not think that I have ever seen such deadly
   paleness in a woman’s face. Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were
   flushed with crying. As <span class="female" title="maryHolder">she swept silently into the room</span> she impressed me
   with a greater sense of grief than the banker had
   done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was
   evidently a woman of strong character, with immense capacity for
   self-restraint. <span class="female" title="maryHolder">Disregarding my presence, she went straight to her uncle and
      passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress</span>.</p>
<p><q class="female-quote">You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated,
      have you not, dad?</q> she asked.</p>
<p><q class="male-quote">No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to
      the bottom.</q></p>
<p><q class="female-quote">But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what
      woman’s instincts are. I know that he has done no harm and that you
      will be sorry for having acted so harshly.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Why is he silent, then, if he is
      innocent?</q></p>
<p><q class="female-quote">Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you
      should suspect him.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">How could I help suspecting him, when I actually
      saw him with the coronet in his hand?</q></p>
<p><q class="female-quote">Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh,
      do, do take my word for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop
      and say no more. It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in
      prison!</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">I shall never let it drop until the gems are
      found—never, Mary! Your affection for
      Arthur blinds you as to the awful
      consequences to me. Far from hushing the thing up, <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">I have brought a
         gentleman down from London to inquire more deeply into
         it.</span></q></p>
<p><q class="female-quote">This gentleman?</q> she asked, facing round to
   me.</p>
<p><q class="male-quote">No, his friend. <span class="sw-action">He wished us to leave him alone</span>.
      He is round in the stable lane now.</q></p>
<p><q class="female-quote">The stable lane?</q> <span class="female" title="maryHolder">She raised her dark
      eyebrows.</span> <q class="female-quote">What can he hope to find there? Ah!
      this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will succeed in
      proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin Arthur is
      innocent of this crime.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with
      you, that we may prove it,</q> returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock
   the snow from his shoes. <q class="sw-quote">I believe I have
      the honour of addressing Miss Mary
      Holder. Might I ask you a question or
      two?</q></p>
<p><q class="female-quote">Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible
      affair up.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">You heard nothing yourself last
      night?</q></p>
<p><q class="female-quote">Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly.
      <span class="female" title="maryHolder">I heard that, and I came down</span>.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">You shut up the windows and doors the night
      before. Did you fasten all the windows?</q></p>
<p><q class="female-quote">Yes.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Were they all fastened this morning?</q></p>
<p><q class="female-quote">Yes.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think
      that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to
      see him?</q></p>
<p><q class="female-quote">Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the
      drawing-room, and who may have heard uncle’s remarks about the
      coronet.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">I see. <span class="female" title="maryHolder">You infer that she may have gone out to
         tell her sweetheart, and that the two may have planned the
         robbery.</span></q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">But what is the good of all these vague
      theories,</q> cried the banker impatiently, <q class="male-quote">when I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet in his
      hands?</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back
      to that. About this girl, Miss Holder.
      You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?</q></p>
<p><q class="female-quote">Yes; <span class="female" title="maryHolder">when I went to see if the door was fastened
         for the night I met her slipping in</span>. I saw the man, too, in the
      gloom.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Do you know him?</q></p>
<p><q class="female-quote">Oh, yes! he is the greengrocer who brings our
      vegetables round. His name is Francis
      Prosper.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">He stood,</q> said Holmes, <q class="sw-quote">to the
      left of the door—that is to say, farther up the path than is
      necessary to reach the door?</q></p>
<p><q class="female-quote">Yes, he did.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">And he is a man with a wooden leg?</q></p>
<p>Something like fear sprang up in the young lady’s expressive black eyes. <q class="female-quote">Why, you are like a magician,</q> said
   she. <q class="female-quote">How do you know that?</q> She smiled,
   but there was no answering smile in Holmes’ thin, eager face.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">I should be very glad now to go upstairs,</q>
   said he. <q class="sw-quote">I shall probably wish to go over the
      outside of the house again. Perhaps I had better take a look at the
      lower windows before I go up.</q></p>
<p><span class="sw-action">He walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the large one
      which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he opened and made a
      very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens.</span>
   <q class="sw-quote">Now we shall go upstairs,</q>
   said he at last.</p>
<p>The banker’s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with a grey
   carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. <span class="sw-action">Holmes went to the bureau first and
      looked hard at the lock.</span></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Which key was used to open it?</q> he
   asked.</p>
<p><q class="male-quote">That which my son himself indicated—that of the
      cupboard of the lumber-room.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Have you it here?</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">That is it on the dressing-table.</q></p>
<p><span class="sw-action">Sherlock Holmes took it up and
      opened the bureau.</span></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">It is a noiseless lock,</q> said he. <q class="sw-quote"> It is no wonder that it did not wake you.
      This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a look at
      it.</q> <span class="sw-action">He opened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it
      upon the table.</span> It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller’s art, and the
   thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one side of the
   coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three gems had been torn
   away.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Now, Mr. Holder,</q> said 
   Holmes, <q class="sw-quote">here is the corner
      which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost.
      Might I beg that you will break it off.</q></p>
<p><span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">The banker recoiled in horror</span>. <q class="male-quote">I should not
      dream of trying,</q> said he.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Then I will.</q>
   <span class="sw-action">Holmes suddenly bent his
      strength upon it, but without result.</span> <q class="sw-quote">I feel
      it give a little,</q> said he; <q class="sw-quote">but,
      though I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me
      all my time to break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what
      do you think would happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a
      noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this happened
      within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of
      it?</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">I do not know what to think. It is all dark to
      me.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do
      you think, Miss Holder?</q></p>
<p><q class="female-quote">I confess that I still share my uncle’s
      perplexity.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw
      him?</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">He had nothing on save only his trousers and
      shirt.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Thank you. We have certainly been favoured with
      extraordinary luck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our
      own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up. With your
      permission, Mr. Holder, I shall now
      continue my investigations outside.</q></p>
<p><span class="sw-action">He went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any unnecessary
      footmarks might make his task more difficult</span>. For an hour or more <span class="sw-action">he was at
      work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as
      inscrutable as ever.</span></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">I think that I have seen now all that there is to
      see, Mr. Holder,</q> said he; <q class="sw-quote">I can serve you best by returning to my
      rooms.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are
      they?</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">I cannot tell.</q></p>
<p>The banker wrung his hands. <q class="male-quote">I shall never see
      them again!</q> he cried. <q class="male-quote">And
      my son? You give me hopes?</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">My opinion is in no way altered.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Then, for God’s sake, what was this dark
      business which was acted in my house last night?</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms
      to-morrow morning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I
      can to make it clearer. I understand that you give me _carte
      blanche_ to act for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and
      that you place no limit on the sum I may draw.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">I would give my fortune to have them
      back.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Very good. I shall look into the matter between
      this and then. Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come
      over here again before evening.</q></p>
<p>It was obvious to me that my companion’s mind was now made up about the case,
   although what his conclusions were was more than I could even dimly imagine.
   Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured to sound him upon
   the point, but he always glided away to some other topic, until at last I
   gave it over in despair. It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our
   rooms once more. <span class="sw-action">He hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few
      minutes dressed as a common loafer.</span> With his collar turned up, his shiny,
   seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of
   the class.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">I think that this should do,</q> <span class="sw-action">said he,
      glancing into the glass above the fireplace</span>. <q class="sw-quote">I only wish that you could come with me, 
      Watson, but I fear that it won’t do. I may be on the
      trail in this matter, or I may be following a will-o’-the-wisp, but
      I shall soon know which it is. I hope that I may be back in a few
      hours.</q> <span class="sw-action">He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the
      sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this
      rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition.</span></p>
<p>I had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent spirits,
   swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. <span class="sw-action">He chucked it down into a
      corner and helped himself to a cup of tea.</span></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">I only looked in as I passed,</q> said he.
   <q class="sw-quote">I am going right on.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Where to?</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be
      some time before I get back. Don’t wait up for me in case I should
      be late.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">How are you getting on?</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been
      out to Streatham since I saw you last, but I did not call at the
      house. It is a very sweet little problem, and I would not have
      missed it for a good deal. However, I must not sit gossiping here,
      but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly
      respectable self.</q></p>
<p>I could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his
   words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled, and there was even a touch of
   colour upon his sallow cheeks. <span class="sw-action">He hastened upstairs, and a few minutes later
      I heard the slam of the hall door</span>, which told me that he was off once more
   upon his congenial hunt.</p>
<p><span class="sw-action">I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I retired to my
      room</span>. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end
   when he was hot upon a scent, so that his lateness caused me no surprise. I
   do not know at what hour he came in, but when I came down to breakfast in
   the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in
   the other, as fresh and trim as possible.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">You will excuse my beginning without you,  Watson,</q> said
   he, <q class="sw-quote">but you remember that our client has
      rather an early appointment this morning.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Why, it is after nine now,</q> I answered. <q class="sw-quote">I should not be surprised if that were he. I
      thought I heard a ring.</q></p>
<p>It was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the change which had
   come over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive
   mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed to me at least a
   shade whiter. <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">He entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more
      painful than his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into
      the armchair which I pushed forward for him.</span></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">I do not know what I have done to be so severely
      tried,</q> said he. <q class="male-quote">Only two
      days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in the
      world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age. One sorrow
      comes close upon the heels of another. My niece, <span class="female" title="maryHolder"> Mary,
         has deserted me</span>.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Deserted you?</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in,
      her room was empty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had
      said to her last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had
      married my boy all might have been well with him. Perhaps it was
      thoughtless of me to say so. It is to that remark that she refers in
      this note:</q></p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote"><q class="female-quote">MY DEAREST
         UNCLE,—I feel that I have brought trouble upon you, and that
         if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might
         never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my mind,
         ever again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must
         leave you forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is
         provided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it
         will be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me. In life
         or in death, I am ever your loving,</q></q></p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote"><q class="female-quote">
         MARY.</q></q></p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">What could she mean by that note, Mr.  Holmes? Do you
      think it points to suicide?</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the
      best possible solution. I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are
      nearing the end of your troubles.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr.
       Holmes;
      you have learned something! Where are the gems?</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">You would not think £ 1000 apiece an excessive
      sum for them?</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">I would pay ten.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will
      cover the matter. And there is a little reward, I fancy. Have you
      your cheque-book? Here is a pen. Better make it out for £
      4000.</q></p>
<p>With a dazed face the banker
   made out the required check. <span class="sw-action">Holmes walked over to his desk,
      took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it,
      and threw it down upon the table</span>.</p>
<p><span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.</span></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">You have it!</q> he gasped. <q class="male-quote">I am saved! I am saved!</q></p>
<p>The reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">he hugged his
      recovered gems to his bosom.</span></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">There is one other thing you owe, Mr.
      Holder,</q> said Sherlock Holmes rather sternly.</p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Owe!</q> <span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">He caught up a pen.</span> <q class="male-quote">Name the sum, and I will pay
      it.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble
      apology to that noble lad, your son, who has carried himself in this
      matter as I should be proud to see my own son do, should I ever
      chance to have one.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Then it was not Arthur who took
      them?</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that
      it was not.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at
      once to let him know that the truth is known.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">He knows it already. When I had cleared it all up
      I had an interview with him, and finding that he would not tell me
      the story, I told it to him, on which <span class="male" title="arthurHolder">he had to confess that I was
         right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear
         to me</span>. Your news of this morning, however, may open his
      lips.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">For Heaven’s sake, tell me, then, what is this
      extraordinary mystery!</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">I will do so, and I will show you the steps by
      which I reached it. And let me say to you, first, that which it is
      hardest for me to say and for you to hear: there has been an
      understanding between Sir George  Burnwell and your niece Mary. They have
      now fled together.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">My Mary? Impossible!</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">It is unfortunately more than possible; it is
      certain. Neither you nor your son knew the true character of this
      man when you admitted him into your family circle. He is one of the
      most dangerous men in England—a ruined gambler, an absolutely
      desperate villain, a man without heart or conscience. Your niece
      knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his vows to her, as he
      had done to a hundred before her, <span class="female" title="maryHolder">she flattered herself that she
         alone had touched his heart.</span> The devil knows best what he said, but
      at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him
      nearly every evening.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">I cannot, and I will not, believe it!</q>
   cried the banker with an
   ashen face.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">I will tell you, then, what occurred in your
      house last night. <span class="female" title="maryHolder">Your niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to
         your room, slipped down and talked to her lover through the window
         which leads into the stable lane</span>. His footmarks had pressed right
      through the snow, so long had he stood there. <span class="female" title="maryHolder">She told him of the
         coronet.</span> His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he bent
      her to his will. I have no doubt that she loved you, but there are
      women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves, and
      I think that she must have been one. She had hardly listened to his
      instructions when she saw you coming downstairs, on which <span class="female" title="maryHolder">she closed
         the window rapidly and told you about one of the servants’ escapade
         with her wooden-legged lover</span>, which was all perfectly
      true.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Your boy, <span class="male" title="arthurHolder">Arthur, went to bed
         after his interview with you but he slept badly on account
         of his uneasiness about his club debts.</span> In the middle of the
      night <span class="male" title="arthurHolder">he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose and,
         looking out</span>, was surprised to see <span class="female" title="maryHolder">his cousin walking very
         stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your
         dressing-room</span>. Petrified with astonishment, <span class="male" title="arthurHolder">the lad slipped
         on some clothes and waited there in the dark</span> to see what
      would come of this strange affair. Presently <span class="female" title="maryHolder">she
         emerged from the room again</span>, and in the light of the passage-lamp
      <span class="male" title="arthurHolder">your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands</span>. <span class="female" title="maryHolder">She
         passed down the stairs</span>, and <span class="male" title="arthurHolder">he, thrilling with horror, ran along and
         slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see what
         passed in the hall beneath</span>. <span class="male" title="arthurHolder">He saw her</span> <span class="female" title="maryHolder">stealthily open the window,
         hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then closing it
         once more hurry back to her room, passing quite close to where he
         stood hid behind the curtain</span>.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">As long as she was on the scene he could not take
      any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved.
      But the instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a
      misfortune this would be for you, and how all-important it was to
      set it right. <span class="male" title="arthurHolder">He rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet,
         opened the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane,
         where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight</span>. Sir George
      <span class="male" title="georgeBurnwell">
         Burnwell tried to get away</span>, but
      <span class="male" title="arthurHolder">Arthur caught him, and there was a struggle
         between them, your lad tugging at one side of the coronet,
         and his opponent at the other</span>. In the scuffle, <span class="male" title="arthurHolder">your
         son struck</span> Sir
      George and <span class="male" title="arthurHolder">cut him over the eye</span>. Then something
      suddenly snapped, and <span class="male" title="arthurHolder">your son, finding that he had the coronet in
         his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room,
         and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the
         struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it</span> when you appeared
      upon the scene.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Is it possible?</q> gasped the banker.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote"><span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">You then roused his anger by calling him names</span> at
      a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He
      could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one
      who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands. He
      took the more chivalrous view, however, and preserved her
      secret.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">And that was why <span class="female" title="maryHolder">she shrieked and fainted when
         she saw the coronet</span>,</q> cried Mr. Holder. <q class="male-quote">Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have been!
      And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear
      fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the
      struggle. How cruelly I have misjudged him!</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">When I arrived at the house,</q> continued
   Holmes, <q class="sw-quote">I at once went very carefully round it to
      observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me. I
      knew that none had fallen since the evening before, and also that
      there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions. <span class="sw-action">I passed
         along the tradesmen’s path, but found it all trampled down and
         indistinguishable</span>. Just beyond it, however, at the far side of the
      kitchen door, <span class="female" title="lucyParr">a woman had stood and talked with a man</span>, whose round
      impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg. I could
      even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run back
      swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel
      marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away.
      I thought at the time that this might be the maid and her
      sweetheart, of whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed
      it was so. <span class="sw-action">I passed round the garden without seeing anything more
         than random tracks</span>, which I took to be the police; but when I got
      into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in
      the snow in front of me.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">There was a double line of tracks of a booted
      man, and a second double line which <span class="sw-action">I saw with delight</span> belonged to a
      man with naked feet. <span class="sw-action">I was at once convinced from what you had told
         me that the latter was your son</span>. The first had walked both ways, but
      the other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places
      over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed
      after the other. <span class="sw-action">I followed them up and found they led to the hall
         window</span>, where Boots had worn all the snow away while waiting. Then <span class="sw-action">I
         walked to the other end, which was a hundred yards or more down the
         lane. I saw where Boots had faced round</span>, where the snow was cut up
      as though there had been a struggle, and, finally, where a few drops
      of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not mistaken. <span class="male" title="georgeBurnwell">Boots had
         then run down the lane</span>, and another little smudge of blood showed
      that it was he who had been hurt. When <span class="male" title="georgeBurnwell">he came to the highroad at
         the other end</span>, I found that the pavement had been cleared, so there
      was an end to that clue.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote"><span class="sw-action">On entering the house, however, I examined, as
         you remember, the sill and framework of the hall window with my
         lens,</span> and <span class="sw-action">I could at once see that someone had passed out. I could
         distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been
         placed in coming in. I was then beginning to be able to form an
         opinion as to what had occurred</span>. A man had waited outside the
      window; someone had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by
      your son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had
      each tugged at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries
      which neither alone could have effected. <span class="male" title="arthurHolder">He had returned with the
         prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent</span>. So far
      I was clear. The question now was, who was the man and who was it
      brought him the coronet?</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">It is an old maxim of mine that when you have
      excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must
      be the truth. Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it
      down, so there only remained your niece and the maids. But if it
      were the maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in
      their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his
      cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should
      retain her secret—the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one.
      When <span class="sw-action">I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and how she
         had fainted on seeing the coronet again</span>, my conjecture became a
      certainty.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">And who could it be who was her confederate? A
      lover evidently, for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude
      which she must feel to you? I knew that you went out little, and
      that your circle of friends was a very limited one. But among them
      was Sir George Burnwell. I had heard of him before as being a man
      of evil reputation among women. It must have been <span class="male" title="georgeBurnwell">he who wore those
         boots and retained the missing gems.</span> Even though he knew that Arthur had
      discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was safe, for
      the lad could not say a word without compromising his own
      family.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Well, your own good sense will suggest what
      measures I took next. <span class="sw-action">I went in the shape of a loafer</span> to Sir George’s
      house, <span class="sw-action">managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned
         that his master had cut his head the night before, and, finally, at
         the expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of his
         cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and saw
         that they exactly fitted the tracks.</span></q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><span class="male" title="alexanderHolder">I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane
         yesterday evening</span>,</q> said Mr. Holder.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Precisely. It was I. <span class="sw-action">I found that I had my man,
         so I came home and changed my clothes</span>. It was a delicate part which
      I had to play then, for <span class="sw-action">I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to
         avert scandal, and I knew that so astute a villain would see that
         our hands were tied in the matter. I went and saw him.</span> At first, of
      course, <span class="male" title="georgeBurnwell">he denied everything</span>. But when <span class="sw-action">I gave him every particular
         that had occurred</span>, <span class="male" title="georgeBurnwell">he tried to bluster and took down a
         life-preserver from the wall</span>. I knew my man, however, and <span class="sw-action">I clapped
         a pistol to his head before he could strike</span>. Then he became a little
      more reasonable. <span class="sw-action">I told him that we would give him a price for the
         stones he held—£ 1000 apiece</span>. That brought out the first signs of
      grief that he had shown. <q class="male-quote">Why, dash it
         all!</q><br/> said he, <q class="male-quote">I’ve let
         them go at six hundred for the three!</q> <span class="sw-action">I soon managed
         to get the address of the receiver who had them, on promising him
         that there would be no prosecution.</span> <span class="sw-action">Off I set to him, and after much
         chaffering I got our stones at £ 1000 apiece. Then I looked in upon
         your son, told him that all was right, and eventually got to my bed
         about two o’clock</span>, after what I may call a really hard day’s
      work.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">A day which has saved England from a great
      public scandal,</q> said the banker, rising. <q class="male-quote">Sir, I cannot find words to thank you, but
      you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your skill
      has indeed exceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I must fly
      to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which I have done
      him. As to what you tell me of poor Mary, it goes to my very heart.
      Not even your skill can inform me where she is now.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">I think that we may safely say,</q> returned
   Holmes, <q class="sw-quote">that she is wherever Sir George Burnwell is. It
      is equally certain, too, that whatever her sins are, they will soon
      receive a more than sufficient punishment.</q></p>
