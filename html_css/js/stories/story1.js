<h2>I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA</h2>
<p>
   To SherlockHolmes she is always _the_ woman. I have seldom heard him
   mention her under any other name. In his eyes <span class="female" title="ireneAdler">she eclipses and
      predominates the whole of her sex</span>. It was not that he felt any emotion
   akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly,
   were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He
   was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that
   the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a
   false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe
   and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for
   drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained
   reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely
   adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might
   throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive
   instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not
   be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And
   yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene
   Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.

   I had seen little ofHolmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away
   from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred
   interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master
   of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention,
   while<span class="sw-action">Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian
      soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old
      books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition,
      the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen
      nature</span>. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime,
   and <span class="sw-action">occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of
      observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those
      mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.</span>
   From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of <span class="sw-action">his
      summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up
      of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and
      finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and
      successfully for the reigning family of Holland</span>. Beyond these signs of
   his activity, however, which <span class="sw-action">I merely shared with all the readers of
      the daily press,</span> I knew little of my former friend and companion.
   </p>
<p>
   One night—it was on the twentieth of March, 1888—<span class="sw-action">I was returning from a
      journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when
      my way led me through Baker Street</span>. As <span class="sw-action">I passed the well-remembered
      door</span>, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and
   with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a
   keen desire to seeHolmes again, and to know how he was employing his
   extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even <span class="sw-action">as I
      looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette
      against the blind</span>. <span class="sw-action">He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his
      head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him</span>. To me, who
   knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own
   story. <span class="sw-action">He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created
      dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem</span>. <span class="sw-action">I rang the bell
      and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.</span>
   </p>
<p>
   His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,
   to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, <span class="sw-action">he waved
      me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a
      spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire
      and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion</span>.
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Wedlock suits you,</q> he remarked. <q class="sw-quote">I think,Watson, that you have put
      on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Seven!</q> I answered.
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I
      fancy,Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me
      that you intended to go into harness.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Then, how do you know?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting
      yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless
      servant girl?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">My dearHolmes,</q> said I, <q class="sw-quote">this is too much. You would certainly have
      been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that <span class="sw-action">I had a
         country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess</span>, but as I
      have changed my clothes I can’t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary
      Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there,
      again, I fail to see how you work it out.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <span class="sw-action">He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.</span>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">It is simplicity itself,</q> said he; <q class="sw-quote">my eyes tell me that on the inside
      of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is
      scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by
      someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in
      order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double
      deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a
      particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As
      to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of
      iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right
      forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where
      he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not
      pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <span class="sw-action">I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his
      process of deduction.</span> <q class="sw-quote">When I hear you give your reasons,</q> I remarked,
   <q class="sw-quote">the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I
      could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your
      reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I
      believe that my eyes are as good as yours.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Quite so,</q> <span class="sw-action">he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself
      down into an armchair</span>. <q class="sw-quote">You see, but you do not observe. The
      distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps
      which lead up from the hall to this room.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Frequently.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">How often?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Well, some hundreds of times.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Then how many are there?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">How many? I don’t know.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just
      my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have
      both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these
      little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two
      of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.</q> <span class="sw-action">He threw
      over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open
      upon the table</span>. <q class="sw-quote">It came by the last post,</q> said he. <q class="sw-quote">Read it aloud.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   The note was undated, and without either signature or address.
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o’clock,</q> it
   said, <q class="sw-quote">a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very
      deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of
      Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with
      matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.
      This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your
      chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor
      wear a mask.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">This is indeed a mystery,</q> I remarked. <q class="sw-quote">What do you imagine that it
      means?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has
      data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of
      theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from
      it?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <span class="sw-action">I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was
      written.</span>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,</q> I remarked,
   endeavouring to imitate my companion’s processes. <q class="sw-quote">Such paper could not
      be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and
      stiff.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Peculiar—that is the very word,</q> saidHolmes. <q class="sw-quote">It is not an English
      paper at all. Hold it up to the light.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <span class="sw-action">I did so, and saw a large "E" with a small "g", a "P", and a large "G"
      with a small "t" woven into the texture of the paper.</span>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">What do you make of that?</q> askedHolmes.
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Not at all. The ‘G’ with the small ‘t’ stands for ‘Gesellschaft,’
      which is the German for ‘Company.’ It is a customary contraction like
      our ‘Co.’ ‘P,’ of course, stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the ‘Eg.’ Let us
      glance at our Continental Gazetteer.</q> He took down a heavy brown volume
   from his shelves. <q class="sw-quote">Eglow, Eglonitz—here we are, Egria. It is in a
      German-speaking country—in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. ‘Remarkable
      as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous
      glass-factories and paper-mills.’ Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of
      that?</q> <span class="sw-action">His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud
      from his cigarette.</span>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">The paper was made in Bohemia,</q> I said.
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the
      peculiar construction of the sentence—‘This account of you we have from
      all quarters received.’ A Frenchman or Russian could not have written
      that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only
      remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who
      writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his
      face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our
      doubts.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses’ hoofs and grating
   wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell.<span class="sw-action">Holmes
      whistled.</span>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">A pair, by the sound,</q> said he. <q class="sw-quote">Yes,</q> <span class="sw-action">he continued, glancing out of
      the window.</span> <q class="sw-quote">A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred
      and fifty guineas apiece. There’s money in this case,Watson, if there
      is nothing else.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">I think that I had better go,Holmes.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell.
      And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">But your client—</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes.
      Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the
   passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and
   authoritative tap.
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Come in!</q> saidHolmes.
   </p>
<p>
   <span class="male" title="kingBohemia">A man entered</span> who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches
   in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich
   with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad
   taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and
   fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was
   thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and
   secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming
   beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were
   trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of
   barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He
   carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper
   part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard
   mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand
   was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face
   he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip,
   and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length
   of obstinacy.
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">You had my note?</q> he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly
   marked German accent. <q class="male-quote">I told you that I would call.</q> He looked from
   one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Pray take a seat,</q> saidHolmes. <q class="sw-quote">This is my friend and colleague, Dr.
      Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom
      have I the honour to address?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I
      understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and
      discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme
      importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you
      alone.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <span class="sw-action">I rose to go</span>, but<span class="sw-action">Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into
      my chair</span>. <q class="sw-quote">It is both, or none,</q> said he. <q class="sw-quote">You may say before this
      gentleman anything which you may say to me.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <span class="male" title="kingBohemia">The Count shrugged his broad shoulders</span>. <q class="male-quote">Then I must begin,</q> said he,
   <q class="male-quote">by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of
      that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too
      much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon
      European history.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">I promise,</q> saidHolmes.
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">And I.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">You will excuse this mask,</q> continued our strange visitor. <q class="male-quote">The august
      person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may
      confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is
      not exactly my own.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">I was aware of it,</q> saidHolmes dryly.
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to
      be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and
      seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak
      plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary
      kings of Bohemia.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">I was also aware of that,</q> murmured<span class="sw-action">Holmes, settling himself down in
      his armchair and closing his eyes.</span>
   </p>
<p>
   <span class="male" title="kingBohemia">Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,
      lounging figure of the man</span> who had been no doubt depicted to him as the
   most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe.<span class="sw-action">Holmes
      slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.</span>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,</q> he remarked, <q class="sw-quote">I
      should be better able to advise you.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <span class="male" title="kingBohemia">The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in
      uncontrollable agitation</span>. Then, <span class="male" title="kingBohemia">with a gesture of desperation, he tore
      the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground</span>. <q class="male-quote">You are right,</q>
   he cried; <q class="male-quote">I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Why, indeed?</q> murmuredHolmes. <q class="sw-quote">Your Majesty had not spoken before I
      was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von
      Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of
      Bohemia.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">But you can understand,</q> said <span class="male" title="kingBohemia">our strange visitor, sitting down once
      more and passing his hand over his high white forehead</span>, <q class="male-quote">you can
      understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own
      person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to
      an agent without putting myself in his power. <span class="male" title="kingBohemia">I have come _incognito_
         from Prague for the purpose of consulting you</span>.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Then, pray consult,</q> said<span class="sw-action">Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.
      </span></p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy
      visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress,
      Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,</q> murmuredHolmes without
   opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing
   all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to
   name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish
   information. In this case <span class="sw-action">I found her biography sandwiched in between
      that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a
      monograph upon the deep-sea fishes</span>.
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Let me see!</q> saidHolmes. <q class="sw-quote">Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858.
      Contralto—hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw—yes!
      Retired from operatic stage—ha! Living in London—quite so! Your
      Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person,
      wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting
      those letters back.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">Precisely so. But how—</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Was there a secret marriage?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">None.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">No legal papers or certificates?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">None.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should
      produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to
      prove their authenticity?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">There is the writing.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Pooh, pooh! Forgery.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">My private note-paper.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Stolen.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">My own seal.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Imitated.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">My photograph.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Bought.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">We were both in the photograph.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an
      indiscretion.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">I was mad—insane.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">You have compromised yourself seriously.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">It must be recovered.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">We have tried and failed.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">She will not sell.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Stolen, then.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her
      house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has
      been waylaid. There has been no result.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">No sign of it?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">Absolutely none.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <span class="sw-action">Holmes laughed</span>. <q class="sw-quote">It is quite a pretty little problem,</q> said he.
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">But a very serious one to me,</q> returned the King reproachfully.
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">To ruin me.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">But how?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">I am about to be married.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">So I have heard.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of
      Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is
      herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct
      would bring the matter to an end.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">And Irene Adler?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that
      she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She
      has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most
      resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no
      lengths to which she would not go—none.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">You are sure that she has not sent it yet?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">I am sure.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">And why?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the
      betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Oh, then we have three days yet,</q> saidHolmes with a yawn. <q class="sw-quote">That is
      very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into
      just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the
      present?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count
      Von Kramm.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Then, as to money?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">You have _carte blanche_.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Absolutely?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to
      have that photograph.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">And for present expenses?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid
   it on the table.
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,</q> he
   said.
   </p>
<p>
   <span class="sw-action">Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it
      to him.</span>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">And Mademoiselle’s address?</q> he asked.
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John’s Wood.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <span class="sw-action">Holmes took a note of it</span>. <q class="sw-quote">One other question,</q> said he. <q class="sw-quote">Was the
      photograph a cabinet?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">It was.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have
      some good news for you. And good-night,Watson,</q> he added, as the
   wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. <q class="sw-quote">If you will be
      good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o’clock I should like
      to chat this little matter over with you.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <span class="sw-action">At three o’clock precisely I was at Baker Street</span>, butHolmes had not
   yet returned. The landlady informed me that <span class="sw-action">he had left the house
      shortly after eight o’clock in the morning</span>. <span class="sw-action">I sat down beside the fire,
      however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be</span>.
   I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was
   surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were
   associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still,
   the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a
   character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the
   investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his
   masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which
   made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the
   quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable
   mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very
   possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.
   </p>
<p>
   It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking
   groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and
   disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my
   friend’s amazing powers in the use of disguises, <span class="sw-action">I had to look three
      times before I was certain that it was indeed he</span>. <span class="sw-action">With a nod he
      vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes
      tweed-suited and respectable, as of old.</span> <span class="sw-action">Putting his hands into his
      pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed
      heartily for some minutes.</span>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Well, really!</q> he cried, and then <span class="sw-action">he choked and laughed again until he
      was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair</span>.
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">What is it?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">It’s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed
      my morning, or what I ended by doing.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">I can’t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and
      perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however.
      <span class="sw-action">I left the house a little after eight o’clock this morning in the
         character of a groom out of work</span>. There is a wonderful sympathy and
      freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all
      that there is to know. <span class="sw-action">I soon found Briony Lodge</span>. It is a _bijou_
      villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to
      the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on
      the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor,
      and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could
      open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window
      could be reached from the top of the coach-house. <span class="sw-action">I walked round it and
         examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting
         anything else of interest.</span></q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote"><span class="sw-action">I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there
         was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent
         the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in
         exchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco,
         and as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say
         nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was
         not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to
         listen to.</span></q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">And what of Irene Adler?</q> I asked.
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Oh, <span class="female" title="ireneAdler">she has turned all the men’s heads down in that part. She is the
         daintiest thing under a bonnet on this plane</span>t. So say the
      Serpentine-mews, to a man. <span class="female" title="ireneAdler">She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives
         out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom
         goes out at other times, except when she sings.</span> Has only one male
      visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing,
      never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey
      Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a
      confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews,
      and knew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, <span class="sw-action">I
         began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think
         over my plan of campaign</span>.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter.
      He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between
      them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client,
      his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably
      transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less
      likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should
      continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the
      gentleman’s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it
      widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these
      details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are
      to understand the situation.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote"><span class="sw-action">I am following you closely</span>,</q> I answered.
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up
      to Briony Lodge, and <span class="male" title="godfreyNorton">a gentleman sprang out</span>. He was a remarkably
      handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached—evidently the man of whom
      I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, <span class="male" title="godreyNorton">shouted to the cabman
         to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of
         a man who was thoroughly at home</span>.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">He was in the house about half an hour, and <span class="sw-action">I could catch glimpses of
         him in the windows of the sitting-room</span>, <span class="male" title="godfreyNorton">pacing up and down, talking
         excitedly, and waving his arms</span>. Of her I could see nothing. Presently
      <span class="male" title="godfreyNorton">he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to
         the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it
         earnestly,</span> <q class="male-quote">Drive like the devil,’ he shouted, ‘first to Gross &amp;
         Hankey’s in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the
         Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!</q></q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well
      to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman
      with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all
      the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn’t
      pulled up before <span class="female" title="ireneAdler">she shot out of the hall door and into it</span>. <span class="sw-action">I only
         caught a glimpse of her at the moment</span>, but she was a lovely woman, with
      a face that a man might die for.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote"><q class="female-quote">The Church of St. Monica, John,</q><br/> she cried, <q class="female-quote">and half a sovereign if
         you reach it in twenty minutes.</q></q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">This was quite too good to lose,Watson. I was just balancing whether
      I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a
      cab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby
      fare, but <span class="sw-action">I jumped in before he could object</span>. <q class="sw-quote">The Church of St.
         Monica,</q><br/> said I, <q class="sw-quote">and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty
         minutes.</q> It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was
      clear enough what was in the wind.</q></p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">My cabby drove fast. I don’t think I ever drove faster, but the others
      were there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses
      were in front of the door when I arrived. <span class="sw-action">I paid the man and hurried
         into the church.</span> There was not a soul there save the two whom I had
      followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with
      them. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. <span class="sw-action">I
         lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a
         church.</span> Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to
      me, and <span class="male" title="godfreyNorton">Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.</span></q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote"><q class="male-quote">Thank God,</q><br/> he cried. <q class="male-quote">You’ll do. Come! Come!</q></q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote"><q class="sw-quote">What then?</q> I asked.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote"><q class="male-quote">Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won’t be legal.</q></q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote"><span class="sw-action">I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I
         found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and
         vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in
         the secure tying up </span>of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton,
      bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was <span class="male" title="godfreyNorton, ireneAdler">the gentleman
         thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other</span>, while the
      clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position
      in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it
      that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some
      informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused
      to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky
      appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the
      streets in search of a best man. <span class="female" title="ireneAdler">The bride gave me a sovereign</span>, and I
      mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">This is a very unexpected turn of affairs,</q> said I; <q class="sw-quote">and what then?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Well, <span class="sw-action">I found my plans very seriously menaced</span>. It looked as if the
      pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt
      and energetic measures on my part. <span class="male" title="godfreyNorton, ireneAdler">At the church door, however, they
         separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house.</span> <q class="female-quote">I
         shall drive out in the park at five as usual</q> she said as she left
      him. I heard no more. <span class="male" title="godfreyNorton, ireneAdler">They drove away in different directions</span>, and <span class="sw-action">I
         went off to make my own arrangements</span>.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Which are?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Some cold beef and a glass of beer,</q> <span class="sw-action">he answered, ringing the bell</span>. <q class="sw-quote">I
      have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still
      this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">I shall be delighted.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">You don’t mind breaking the law?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Not in the least.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Nor running a chance of arrest?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Not in a good cause.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Oh, the cause is excellent!</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Then I am your man.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">I was sure that I might rely on you.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">But what is it you wish?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you.
      Now,</q> he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our
   landlady had provided, <q class="sw-quote">I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not
      much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene
      of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at
      seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">And what then?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">You must leave that to me. <span class="sw-action">I have already arranged what is to occur.
         </span>There is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere,
      come what may. You understand?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">I am to be neutral?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small
      unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed
      into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window
      will open. You are to station yourself close to that open window.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Yes.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Yes.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">And when I raise my hand—so—you will throw into the room what I give
      you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You
      quite follow me?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Entirely.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">It is nothing very formidable,</q> <span class="sw-action">he said, taking a long cigar-shaped
      roll from his pocket</span>. <q class="sw-quote">It is an ordinary plumber’s smoke-rocket, fitted
      with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is
      confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up
      by quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the
      street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made
      myself clear?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at
      the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and
      to wait you at the corner of the street.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Precisely.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Then you may entirely rely on me.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare
      for the new role I have to play.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <span class="sw-action">He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the
      character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman</span>. His
   broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic
   smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such
   as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that
   Holmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul
   seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a
   fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a
   specialist in crime.
   </p>
<p>
   It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still
   wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine
   Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as
   we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming
   of its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from
   SherlockHolmes’ succinct description, but the locality appeared to be
   less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a
   quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of
   shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a
   scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a
   nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and
   down with cigars in their mouths.
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">You see,</q> remarkedHolmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the
   house, <q class="sw-quote">this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes
      a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse
      to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming
      to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find
      the photograph?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Where, indeed?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet
      size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman’s dress. She knows
      that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two
      attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that
      she does not carry it about with her.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Where, then?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am
      inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like
      to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else?
      She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what
      indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a
      business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within
      a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be
      in her own house.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">But it has twice been burgled.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Pshaw! They did not know how to look.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">But how will you look?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">I will not look.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">What then?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">I will get her to show me.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">But she will refuse.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her
      carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   As he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the
   curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to
   the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at
   the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a
   copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with
   the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by
   the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the
   scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was
   struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage,
   was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who
   struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks.Holmes
   dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her,
   <span class="sw-action">he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely
      down his face</span>. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one
   direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better
   dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it,
   crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene
   Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but <span class="female" title="ireneAdler">she
      stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of
      the hall, looking back into the street</span>.
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="female-quote">Is the poor gentleman much hurt?</q> she asked.
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">He is dead,</q> cried several voices.
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">No, no, there’s life in him!</q> shouted another. <q class="male-quote">But he’ll be gone
      before you can get him to hospital.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="female-quote">He’s a brave fellow,</q> said a woman. <q class="female-quote">They would have had the lady’s
      purse and watch if it hadn’t been for him. They were a gang, and a
      rough one, too. Ah, he’s breathing now.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">He can’t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="female-quote">Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa.
      This way, please!</q>
   </p>
<p>
   Slowly and solemnly <span class="sw-action">he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the
      principal room</span>, while <span class="sw-action">I still observed the proceedings from my post by
      the window</span>. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn,
   so that I could seeHolmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know
   whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he
   was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of
   myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I
   was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon
   the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery toHolmes
   to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened
   my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I
   thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from
   injuring another.
   </p>
<p>
   <span class="sw-action">Holmes had sat up upon the couch</span>, and I saw him motion like a man who
   is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At
   the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal <span class="sw-action">I tossed my
      rocket into the room</span> with a cry of <q class="sw-quote">Fire!</q> The word was no sooner out
   of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and
   ill—gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids—joined in a general shriek of
   <q class="sw-quote">Fire!</q> Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the
   open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later
   the voice ofHolmes from within assuring them that it was a false
   alarm. <span class="sw-action">Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner
      of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend’s arm
      in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar</span>. <span class="sw-action">He walked swiftly
      and in silence for some few minutes</span> until we had turned down one of the
   quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">You did it very nicely, Doctor,</q> he remarked. <q class="sw-quote">Nothing could have been
      better. It is all right.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">You have the photograph?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">I know where it is.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">And how did you find out?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">She showed me, as I told you she would.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">I am still in the dark.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">I do not wish to make a mystery,</q> said he, laughing. <q class="sw-quote">The matter was
      perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was
      an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">I guessed as much.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the
      palm of my hand. <span class="sw-action">I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my
         face, and became a piteous spectacle</span>. It is an old trick.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">That also I could fathom.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could
      she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I
      suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to
      see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were
      compelled to open the window, and you had your chance.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">How did that help you?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire,
      her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It
      is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken
      advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it
      was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married
      woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box.
      Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house
      more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to
      secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting
      were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The
      photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right
      bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as
      she half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she
      replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have
      not seen her since. <span class="sw-action">I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the
         house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once</span>;
      but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it
      seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">And now?</q> I asked.
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King
      to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown
      into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that
      when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be
      a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">And when will you call?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a
      clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a
      complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without
      delay.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. <span class="sw-action">He was
      searching his pockets for the key</span> when someone passing said:
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">Good-night, Mister SherlockHolmes.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting
   appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">I’ve heard that voice before,</q> saidHolmes, staring down the dimly lit
   street. <q class="sw-quote">Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast
   and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the
   room.
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">You have really got it!</q> he cried, grasping SherlockHolmes by either
   shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Not yet.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">But you have hopes?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">I have hopes.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">We must have a cab.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">No, my brougham is waiting.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Then that will simplify matters.</q> We descended and started off once
   more for Briony Lodge.
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Irene Adler is married,</q> remarkedHolmes.
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">Married! When?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Yesterday.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">But to whom?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">To an English lawyer named Norton.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">But she could not love him.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">I am in hopes that she does.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">And why in hopes?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If
      the lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does
      not love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with
      your Majesty’s plan.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">It is true. And yet—! Well! I wish she had been of my own station!
      What a queen she would have made!</q> He relapsed into a moody silence,
   which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.
   </p>
<p>
   The door of Briony Lodge was open, and <span class="female" title="elderlyWoman">an elderly woman stood upon the
      steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the
      brougham.</span>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="female-quote">Mr. SherlockHolmes, I believe?</q> said she.
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">I am Mr.Holmes,</q> answered <span class="sw-action">my companion, looking at her with a
      questioning and rather startled gaze</span>.
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="female-quote">Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call.<span class="female" title="ireneAdler">She left
         this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for
         the Continent</span>.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">What!</q> <span class="sw-action">SherlockHolmes staggered back, white with chagrin and
      surprise.</span> <q class="sw-quote">Do you mean that she has left England?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="female-quote">Never to return.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">And the papers?</q> asked the King hoarsely. <q class="female-quote">All is lost.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">We shall see.</q> He pushed past the servant and rushed into the
   drawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was
   scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open
   drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight.
   Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and,
   plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The
   photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was
   superscribed to SherlockHolmes, Esq. To be left till called for. My
   friend tore it open, and we all three read it together. It was dated at
   midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="female-quote">MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,—You really did it very well. You took
      me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a
      suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I
      began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had
      been told that, if the King employed an agent, it would certainly
      be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you
      made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became
      suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old
      clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself.
      Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the
      freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you,
      ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I call them, and came
      down just as you departed.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="female-quote">Well, <span class="female" title="ireneAdler">I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was
         really an object of interest</span> to the celebrated Mr. SherlockHolmes.
      Then <span class="female" title="ireneAdler">I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for
         the Temple to see my husband</span>.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="female-quote">We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so
      formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you
      call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in
      peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may do
      what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly
      wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a
      weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might
      take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to
      possess; and I remain, dear Mr. SherlockHolmes,</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="female-quote">Very truly yours,</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="female-quote">“IRENE NORTON, _née_ ADLER.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">What a woman—oh, what a woman!</q> cried the King of Bohemia, when we had
   all three read this epistle. <q class="male-quote">Did I not tell you how quick and resolute
      she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity
      that she was not on my level?</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">From what I have seen of the lady, she seems, indeed, to be on a very
      different level to your Majesty,</q> saidHolmes coldly. <q class="sw-quote">I am sorry that
      I have not been able to bring your Majesty’s business to a more
      successful conclusion.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">On the contrary, my dear sir,</q> cried the King; <q class="male-quote">nothing could be more
      successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as
      safe as if it were in the fire.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">I am glad to hear your Majesty say so.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward
      you. This ring—</q> <span class="male" title="kingBohemia">He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and
      held it out upon the palm of his hand</span>.
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly,</q>
   saidHolmes.
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">You have but to name it.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">This photograph!</q>
   </p>
<p>
   The King stared at him in amazement.
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="male-quote">Irene’s photograph!</q> he cried. <q class="male-quote">Certainly, if you wish it.</q>
   </p>
<p>
   <q class="sw-quote">I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter.
      I have the honour to wish you a very good morning.</q> <span class="sw-action">He bowed, and,
      turning away</span> without observing the hand which the King had stretched
   out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.
   </p>
<p>
   And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of
   Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. SherlockHolmes were beaten by a
   woman’s wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I
   have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or
   when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable
   title of _the_ woman.
