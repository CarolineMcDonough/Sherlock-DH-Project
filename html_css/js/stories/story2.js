<h2>II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE</h2>
<p><span class="sw-action">I had called</span> upon my
   friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep
   conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair.
   With an apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when <span class="sw-action">Holmes pulled me abruptly</span>
   into the room and closed the door behind me.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">You could not possibly have come at a better time, my
      dear Watson,</q> he said cordially.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">I was afraid that you were engaged.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">So I am. Very much so.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Then I can wait in the next room.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my
      partner and helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he
      will be of the utmost use to me in yours also.</q></p>
<p><span class="male" title="jabezWilson">The stout gentleman half rose from
      his chair and gave a bob of greeting</span>, with a quick little questioning
   glance from his small fat-encircled eyes.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Try the settee,</q> said <span class="sw-action">Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting his
      fingertips together</span>, as was his custom when in judicial moods. <q class="sw-quote">I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that
      is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You
      have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle,
      and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own little
      adventures.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to
      me,</q> I observed.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">You will remember that I remarked the other day, just
      before we went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that
      for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which
      is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">A proposition which I took the liberty of
      doubting.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to
      my view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your
      reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, <span class="male" title="jabezWilson">Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good
         enough to call upon me</span> this morning, and to begin a narrative which
      promises to be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some time. You
      have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often
      connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed,
      where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. As far
      as I have heard, it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an
      instance of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the most
      singular that I have ever listened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great
      kindness to recommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr.
      Watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the
      story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when
      I have heard some slight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide
      myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory. In the
      present instance I am forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief,
      unique.</q></p>
<p><span class="male" title="jabezWilson">The portly client puffed out his
      chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled
      newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat</span>. As he glanced down the
   advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon
   his
   knee, <span class="sw-action">I took a good look</span>
   at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the indications
   which might be presented by his dress or appearance.</p>
<p>I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore every mark of
   being
   an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather
   baggy
   grey shepherd's check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the
   front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced
   bit
   of metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat
   with
   a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether, look as I would,
   there
   was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression
   of
   extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.</p>
<p><span class="sw-action">Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took
      in my occupation</span>, and <span class="sw-action">he shook his head</span> with a smile as he noticed my questioning
   glances. <q class="sw-quote">Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some
      time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has
      been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can
      deduce nothing else.</q></p>
<p><span class="male" title="jabezWilson">Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his
      chair</span>, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my
   companion.</p>
<p><q class="male-quote">How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr.
      Holmes?</q> he asked. <q class="male-quote">How did you know, for
      example, that I did manual labour. It's as true as gospel, for I began as a ship's
      carpenter.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size
      larger than your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more
      developed.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">I won't insult your intelligence by telling you how I
      read that, especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an
      arc-and-compass breastpin.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very
      shiny for five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where
      you rest it upon the desk?</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Well, but China?</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your
      right wrist could only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo
      marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. That trick of
      staining the fishes' scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in
      addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes
      even more simple.</q></p>
<p>Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. <q class="male-quote">Well, I never!</q>
   said he. <q class="male-quote">I thought at first that you had done something
      clever, but I see that there was nothing in it after all.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">I begin to think, Watson,</q> said Holmes, <q class="sw-quote">that I make a mistake in explaining. '_Omne ignotum pro
      magnifico_,' you know, and my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer
      shipwreck if I am so candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr.
      Wilson?</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Yes, I have got it now,</q> he answered with his thick
   red finger planted halfway down the column. <q class="male-quote">Here it is.
      This is what began it all. You just read it for yourself, sir.</q></p>
<p><span class="sw-action">I took the paper from him and
      read</span> as follows:</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of
      the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., there is now another
      vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a salary of Â£ 4 a week for
      purely nominal services. All red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above
      the age of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at eleven
      o'clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7 Pope's Court, Fleet
      Street.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">What on earth does this mean?</q> I ejaculated after I
   had twice read over the extraordinary announcement.</p>
<p><span class="sw-action">Holmes chuckled and wriggled in
      his chair</span>, as was his habit when in high spirits. <q class="sw-quote">It is a little off the beaten track, isn't it?</q> said
   he. <q class="sw-quote">And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell
      us all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had
      upon your fortunes. You will first make a note, Doctor, of the paper and the
      date.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">It is _The Morning Chronicle_ of April 27, 1890. Just two
      months ago.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock
      Holmes,</q> said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; <q class="male-quote">I have a small pawnbroker's business at Coburg Square, near
      the City. It's not a very large affair, and of late years it has not done more than
      just give me a living. I used to be able to keep two assistants, but now
      <span class="male" title="jabezWilson">I only keep
         one</span>; and I would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come
      for half wages so as to learn the business.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">What is the name of this obliging youth?</q> asked
   Sherlock Holmes.</p>
<p><q class="male-quote">His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he's not such a youth,
      either. It's hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes;
      and I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I am able to
      give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his
      head?</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an
      _employÃ©_ who comes under the full market price. It is not a common experience among
      employers in this age. I don't know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your
      advertisement.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Oh, he has his faults, too,</q> said Mr. Wilson. <q class="male-quote">Never was such a fellow for photography. Snapping away with a
      camera when he ought to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar
      like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his main fault, but on
      the whole he's a good worker. There's no vice in him.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">He is still with you, I presume?</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of
      simple cooking and keeps the place cleanâthat's all I have in the house, for I am
      a
      widower and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three of us; and
      we
      keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.</q></p>
<p>The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. <span class="male" title="jabezWilson"> Spaulding, he came down into the office</span> just
   this day eight weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:</p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">I wish to the Lord, Mr.
         Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.</q><br/>
      <q class="male-quote">Why that?</q><br/> I asks. <q class="male-quote"> Why,</q><br/> says he, <q class="male-quote">heres another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed
         Men. It's worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it, and I understand
         that there are more vacancies than there are men, so that the trustees are at
         their wits' end what to do with the money. If my hair would only change colour,
         here's a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.</q><br/>
      <q class="male-quote">Why, what is it, then?</q><br/> I asked. You see, Mr.
      Holmes, I am a very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my
      having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the
      door-mat. In that way I didn't know much of what was going on outside, and I was
      always glad of a bit of news. <q class="male-quote">Have you never heard
         of the League of the Red-headed Men?</q><br/> he asked with his eyes open. <q class="male-quote">Never.</q><br/>
      <q class="male-quote">Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible
         yourself for one of the vacancies.</q><br/>
      <q class="male-quote">And what are they worth?</q><br/> I asked. <q class="male-quote">Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work
         is slight, and it need not interfere very much with one's other
         occupations.</q></q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my
      ears, for the business has not been over good for some years, and an extra couple
      of
      hundred would have been very handy.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">Tell me all about it,</q><br/>
      said I. <q class="male-quote">Well,</q><br/> said <span class="male" title="vincentSpaulding"> he, showing me the
         advertisement</span>, <q class="male-quote">you can see for
         yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where you
         should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the League was founded
         by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways.
         He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men;
         so, when he died, it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the
         hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of
         easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear it is splendid
         pay and very little to do.</q><br/>
      <q class="male-quote">But,</q><br/> said I, <q class="male-quote">there
         would be millions of red-headed men who would apply.</q><br/>
      <q class="male-quote">Not so many as you might think,</q><br/> he answered.
      <q class="male-quote">You see it is really confined to Londoners, and
         to grown men. This American had started from London when he was young, and he
         wanted to do the old town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use
         your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real
         bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would
         just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself
         out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.</q></q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves,
      that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there
      was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance as any man that I
      had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he
      might prove useful, so <span class="male" title="jabezWilson">I just
         ordered</span>
      <span class="male" title="vincentSpaulding">him to put up the
         shutters\ for the day and to come right away with me.</span> He was very
      willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for the
      address that was given us in the advertisement.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes.
      From north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had
      tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet Street was choked with
      red-headed folk, and Pope's Court looked like a coster's orange barrow. I should not
      have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by
      that single advertisement. Every shade of colour they wereâstraw, lemon, orange,
      brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who
      had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how many were waiting,
      <span class="male" title="jabezWilson">I would have given it
         up</span> in despair; but Spaulding would not hear of it. How he did it I
      could not imagine, but <span class="male" title="vincentSpaulding">he
         pushed and pulled and butted</span> until <span class="male" title="vincentSpaulding">he got me through the crowd</span>, and
      right up to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon the
      stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but <span class="male" title="jabezWilson, vincentSpaulding">we wedged
         in</span> as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the
      office.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Your experience has been a most entertaining one,</q>
   remarked Holmes as <span class="male" title="jabezWilson">his client
      paused and refreshed his memory</span> with a huge pinch of snuff. <q class="sw-quote">Pray continue your very interesting statement.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden
      chairs and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even
      redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then
      <span class="male" title="duncanRoss">he always managed to
         find</span> some fault in them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy
      did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn came
      the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others, and
      <span class="male" title="duncanRoss">he closed the
         door</span> as we entered, so that he might have a private word with
      us.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">
      <q class="male-quote">This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,</q><br/> said my assistant,
      <q class="male-quote">and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the
         League.</q><br/>
      <q class="male-quote">And he is admirably suited for it,</q><br/> the other
      answered. <q class="male-quote">He has every requirement. I cannot recall when
         I have seen anything so fine.</q><br/>
      <span class="male" title="duncanRoss">He took a step backward, cocked
         his head on one side, and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful.</span>
      Then suddenly <span class="male" title="duncanRoss">he plunged
         forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success</span>.
      <q class="male-quote">It would be injustice to hesitate,</q><br/> said he.
      <q class="male-quote">You will, however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an
         obvious precaution.</q><br/> With that <span class="male" title="duncanRoss">he seized my hair in both his hands, and
         tugged</span> until I yelled with the pain. <q class="male-quote">There
         is water in your eyes,</q><br/> said he as <span class="male" title="duncanRoss">he released me</span>. <q class="male-quote">I perceive that all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have
         twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales of
         cobbler's wax which would disgust you with human nature.</q><br/>
      <span class="male" title="duncanRoss">He stepped over to the window
         and shouted</span> through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was
      filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped away
      in different directions until there was not a red-head to be seen except my own and
      that of the manager. <q class="male-quote">My name,</q><br/> said he, <q class="male-quote">is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the pensioners
         upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a married man, Mr. Wilson?
         Have you a family?</q><br/> I answered that <q class="male-quote">I had
         not</q><br/>. His face fell immediately. <q class="male-quote">Dear
         me!</q><br/> he said gravely, <q class="male-quote">that is very serious
         indeed! I am sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the
         propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is
         exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.</q><br/> My face lengthened
      at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not to have the vacancy after all; but
      after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right. <q class="male-quote">In the case of another,</q><br/> said he, <q class="male-quote"> the objection might be fatal, but we must stretch a point
         in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours. When shall you be able to
         enter upon your new duties?</q><br/>
      <q class="male-quote">Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business
         already,</q><br/> said I. <q class="male-quote">Oh, never mind about
         that, Mr. Wilson!</q><br/> said Vincent Spaulding. <q class="male-quote">I should be able to look after that for you.</q><br/>
      <q class="male-quote">What would be the hours?</q><br/> I asked. <q class="male-quote">Ten to two.</q>
      </q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening,
      Mr. Holmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day;
      so
      it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings. Besides, I knew that
      my
      assistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that turned
      up.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">That would suit me very
         well,</q><br/> said I. <q class="male-quote">And the pay?</q><br/>
      <q class="male-quote">Is Â£ 4 a week.</q><br/>
      <q class="male-quote">And the work?</q><br/>
      <q class="male-quote">Is purely nominal.</q><br/>
      <q class="male-quote">What do you call purely nominal?</q><br/>
      <q class="male-quote">Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the
         building, the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever.
         The will is very clear upon that point. You don't comply with the conditions if
         you budge from the office during that time.</q><br/>
      <q class="male-quote">It's only four hours a day, and I should not think of
         leaving,</q><br/> said I. <q class="male-quote">No excuse will avail,</q><br/>
      said Mr. Duncan Ross; <q class="male-quote">neither sickness nor business nor
         anything else. There you must stay, or you lose your billet.</q><br/>
      <q class="male-quote">And the work?</q><br/>
      <q class="male-quote">Is to copy out the _EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica_. There is
         the first volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and
         blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready
         to-morrow?</q><br/>
      <q class="male-quote">Certainly,</q><br/> I answered. <q class="male-quote">Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once more on the
         important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain.</q>
      <span class="male" title="duncanRoss">He bowed me out</span> of the
      room and <span class="male" title="jabezWilson">I went home</span>
      with my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good
      fortune.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Well, <span class="male" title="jabezWilson">I thought over the matter</span> all day, and by evening I was in
      low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be
      some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I could not imagine. It
      seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would
      pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the _EncyclopÃ¦dia
      Britannica_. <span class="male" title="vincentSpaulding">Vincent
         Spaulding did what he could</span> to cheer me up, but by bedtime
      <span class="male" title="jabezWilson">I had reasoned myself
         out of the whole thing</span>. However, in the morning <span class="male" title="jabezWilson">I determined to have a look</span>
      at it anyhow, so <span class="male" title="jabezWilson">I bought a
         penny bottle of ink</span>, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap
      paper, <span class="male" title="jabezWilson">I started off for
         Pope's Court</span>.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as
      possible. The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to see
      that I got fairly to work. <span class="male" title="duncanRoss">He
         started me off</span> upon the letter A, and then <span class="male" title="duncanRoss">he left me</span>; but <span class="male" title="duncanRoss">he would drop in</span> from time
      to time to see that all was right with me. At two o'clock <span class="male" title="duncanRoss">he bade me good-day, complimented me
         upon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office after
         me.</span></q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday
      <span class="male" title="duncanRoss">the manager came in and
         planked down four golden sovereigns</span> for my week's work. It was the same
      next week, and the same the week after. Every morning <span class="male" title="jabezWilson">I was there at ten</span>, and every afternoon
      <span class="male" title="jabezWilson">I left at
         two</span>. By degrees <span class="male" title="duncanRoss">Mr. Duncan
         Ross took to coming in only once of a morning</span>, and then,
      after a time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to leave
      the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet was
      such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk the loss of
      it.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Eight weeks passed away like this, and <span class="male" title="jabezWilson">I had written</span> about Abbots
      and Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with diligence that
      I
      might get on to the B's before very long. It cost me something in foolscap, and
      <span class="male" title="jabezWilson">I had pretty nearly
         filled a shelf</span> with my writings. And then suddenly the whole business
      came to an end.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">To an end?</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. <span class="male" title="jabezWilson">I went to my work</span> as usual
      at ten o'clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square of cardboard
      hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here it is, and you can read for
      yourself.</q></p>
<p>He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper. It
   read in
   this fashion:</p>
<p><q class="male-quote">THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE IS DISSOLVED. October 9,
      1890.</q></p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it,
   until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration
   that we both burst out into a roar of laughter.</p>
<p><q class="male-quote">I cannot see that there is anything very funny,</q>
   cried our client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. <q class="male-quote">If you can do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go
      elsewhere.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">No, no,</q> cried Holmes, shoving him back into the
   chair from which he had half risen. <q class="sw-quote">I really wouldn't
      miss your case for the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you
      will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps
      did you take when you found the card upon the door?</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then
      <span class="male" title="jabezWilson">I called at the
         offices</span> round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it.
      Finally, <span class="male" title="jabezWilson">I went to the
         landlord,</span> who is an accountant living on the ground floor, and I asked
      him if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he
      had never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He
      answered that the name was new to him.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><q class="male-quote">Well,</q><br/> said I, <q class="male-quote">the gentleman at No. 4.</q><br/>
      <q class="male-quote">What, the red-headed man?</q><br/>
      <q class="male-quote">Yes.</q><br/>
      <q class="male-quote">Oh,</q><br/> said he, <q class="male-quote">his name
         was William Morris. He was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary
         convenience until his new premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.</q><br/>
      <q class="male-quote">Where could I find him?</q><br/>
      <q class="male-quote">Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes,
         17 King Edward Street, near St. Paul's.</q><br/>
      <q class="male-quote"><span class="male" title="jabezWilson">I
            started off</span>, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a
         manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either
         Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.</q></q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">And what did you do then?</q> asked Holmes.</p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><span class="male" title="jabezWilson">I went
         home to Saxe-Coburg Square</span>, and <span class="male" title="jabezWilson">I
         took the advice</span> of my assistant. But he could not help me in any way.
      He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite
      good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so,
      as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in
      need of it, <span class="male" title="jabezWilson">I came right away
         to you.</span></q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">And you did very wisely,</q> said Holmes. <q class="sw-quote">Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be
      happy to look into it. From what you have told me I think that it is possible that
      graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Grave enough!</q> said Mr. Jabez Wilson. <q class="male-quote">Why, I have lost four pound a week.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">As far as you are personally concerned,</q> remarked
   Holmes, <q class="sw-quote">I do not see that you have any grievance against
      this extraordinary league. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some
      Â£ 30, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject
      which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they
      are, and what their object was in playing this prankâif it was a prankâupon me. It
      was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty
      pounds.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And,
      first, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called
      your attention to the advertisementâhow long had he been with you?</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">About a month then.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">How did he come?</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">In answer to an advertisement.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Was he the only applicant?</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">No, I had a dozen.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Why did you pick him?</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Because he was handy and would come cheap.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">At half wages, in fact.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Yes.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his
      face, though he's not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his
      forehead.</q></p>
<p>Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. <q class="sw-quote">I
      thought as much,</q> said he. <q class="sw-quote">Have you ever
      observed that his ears are pierced for earrings?</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when
      he was a lad.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Hum!</q> said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought.
   <q class="sw-quote">He is still with you?</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">And has your business been attended to in your
      absence?</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Nothing to complain of, sir. There's never very much to do
      of a morning.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an
      opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I
      hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Well, Watson,</q> said Holmes when our visitor had
   left us, <q class="sw-quote">what do you make of it all?</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">I make nothing of it,</q> I answered frankly. <q class="sw-quote">It is a most mysterious business.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">As a rule,</q> said Holmes, <q class="sw-quote">the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves
      to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just
      as
      a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this
      matter.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">What are you going to do, then?</q> I asked.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">To smoke,</q> he answered. <q class="sw-quote">It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that you won't
      speak to me for fifty minutes.</q>
   <span class="sw-action">He curled himself up in his
      chair</span>, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and there
   <span class="sw-action">he sat with his eyes
      closed</span> and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange
   bird. <span class="sw-action">I had come to the
      conclusion</span> that he had dropped asleep, and indeed <span class="sw-action">was nodding myself</span>, when <span class="sw-action">he suddenly sprang out of his chair
      with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down</span>
   upon the mantelpiece.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Sarasate plays at the St. James's Hall this
      afternoon,</q> he remarked. <q class="sw-quote">What do you think,
      Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few hours?</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very
      absorbing.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Then put on your hat and come. <span class="sw-action">I am going through the
         City</span> first, and we can have some lunch on the way. <span class="sw-action">I observe</span> that there is
      a good deal of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than
      Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come
      along!</q></p>
<p><span class="sw-action">We
      travelled</span> by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk took us
   to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in
   the
   morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy
   two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn
   of
   weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a
   smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with "JABEZ
   WILSON" in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed
   client carried on his business. <span class="sw-action">Sherlock Holmes stopped in front</span> of it with his head on one
   side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids.
   Then
   <span class="sw-action">he walked slowly up the
      street</span>, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the
   houses. Finally <span class="sw-action">he returned to
      the pawnbroker's</span>, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his
   stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly
   <span class="male" title="vincentSpaulding">opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow</span>, who asked him to step in.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Thank you,</q> said Holmes, <q class="sw-quote">I only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the
      Strand.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Third right, fourth left,</q> answered the
   <span class="male" title="vincentSpaulding">assistant promptly, closing the
      door.</span></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Smart fellow, that,</q> observed Holmes as we walked
   away. <q class="sw-quote">He is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in
      London, and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have
      known something of him before.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Evidently,</q> said I, <q class="sw-quote">Mr.
      Wilson's assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League.
      I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see
      him.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Not him.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">What then?</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">The knees of his trousers.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">And what did you see?</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">What I expected to see.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Why did you beat the pavement?</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for
      talk. We are spies in an enemy's country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square.
      Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.</q></p>
<p>The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired
   Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does
   to
   the back. It was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to
   the
   north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing
   in a
   double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm
   of pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops
   and
   stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded
   and
   stagnant square which we had just quitted.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Let me see,</q> said <span class="sw-action">Holmes, standing at the corner and
      glancing</span> along the line, <q class="sw-quote">I should like just
      to remember the order of the houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact
      knowledge of London. There is Mortimer's, the tobacconist, the little newspaper
      shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant,
      and McFarlane's carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the other
      block. And now, Doctor, we've done our work, so it's time we had some play. A
      sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness
      and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their
      conundrums.</q></p>
<p>My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer
   but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the afternoon <span class="sw-action">he sat in the stalls</span> wrapped in the most
   perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while
   his
   gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the
   sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as
   it was
   possible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted
   itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought,
   the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated
   in him. The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy;
   and,
   as I knew well, he was never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had
   been
   lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions. Then
   it
   was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant
   reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted
   with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that
   of
   other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James's
   Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to
   hunt
   down.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,</q> he
   remarked as we emerged.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Yes, it would be as well.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">And I have some business to do which will take some
      hours. This business at Coburg Square is serious.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Why serious?</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every
      reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday
      rather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">At what time?</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Ten will be early enough.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">I shall be at Baker Street at ten.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little
      danger, so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket.</q>
   <span class="sw-action">He waved his hand, turned on
      his heel, and disappeared in an instant</span> among the crowd.</p>
<p>I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always oppressed with
   a
   sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what
   he
   had heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that
   he
   saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the
   whole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my house in
   Kensington <span class="sw-action">I thought over it
      all</span>, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the
   _EncyclopÃ¦dia_ down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with
   which
   he had parted from me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?
   Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes that this
   smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a formidable manâa man who might play a deep
   game. <span class="sw-action">I tried to puzzle it
      out</span>, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should
   bring an explanation.</p>
<p>It was a quarter-past nine when <span class="sw-action">I
      started from home</span> and made my way across the Park, and so through Oxford
   Street to Baker Street. Two hansoms were
   standing at the door, and as <span class="sw-action">I entered the passage</span> I heard the sound of voices from above.
   On entering his room, <span class="sw-action">I found
      Holmes</span> in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as
   Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced
   man,
   with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Ha! Our party is complete,</q> said <span class="sw-action">Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket
      and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack</span>. <q class="sw-quote">Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let
      me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night's
      adventure.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">We're hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,</q> said
   Jones in his consequential way. <q class="male-quote">Our friend here is a
      wonderful man for starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the
      running down.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our
      chase,</q> observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.</p>
<p><q class="male-quote">You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes,
      sir,</q> said the police agent loftily. <q class="male-quote">He has his
      own little methods, which are, if he won't mind my saying so, just a little too
      theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not
      too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the
      Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official force.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,</q>
   said the stranger with deference. <q class="male-quote">Still, I confess that
      I miss my rubber. It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I
      have not had my rubber.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">I think you will find,</q> said Sherlock Holmes,
   <q class="sw-quote">that you will play for a higher stake to-night than
      you have ever done yet, and that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr.
      Merryweather, the stake will be some Â£ 30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the
      man upon whom you wish to lay your hands.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He's a
      young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would
      rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He's a remarkable
      man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been
      to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet signs
      of him at every turn, we never know where to find the man himself. He'll crack a
      crib in Scotland one week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall
      the next. I've been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him
      yet.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you
      to-night. I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with
      you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however, and quite
      time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom, Watson and I will
      follow in the second.</q></p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the
   cab
   humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon. We rattled through an endless
   labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into Farrington Street.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">We are close there now,</q> my friend remarked.
   <q class="sw-quote">This fellow Merryweather is a bank director, and
      personally interested in the matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us
      also. He is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has
      one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if
      he
      gets his claws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us.</q></p>
<p>We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the
   morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather,
   we
   passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which <span class="male" title="mrMerryweather">he opened for us</span>. Within there was a small
   corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was opened, and led down
   a
   flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate.
   <span class="male" title="mrMerryweather">Mr. Merryweather
      stopped to light a lantern</span>, and then conducted us down a dark,
   earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar,
   which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">You are not very vulnerable from above,</q> Holmes
   remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him.</p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Nor from below,</q> said <span class="male" title="mrMerryweather">Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags</span> which lined
   the floor. <q class="male-quote">Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!</q>
   he remarked, looking up in surprise.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!</q>
   said Holmes severely. <q class="sw-quote">You have already imperilled the
      whole success of our expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit
      down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?</q></p>
<p>The solemn <span class="male" title="mrMerryweather">Mr. Merryweather
      perched himself upon a crate</span>, with a very injured expression upon his face,
   while <span class="sw-action">Holmes fell upon his
      knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to
      examine</span> minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to
   satisfy him, for <span class="sw-action">he sprang to
      his feet again and put his glass in his pocket.</span></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">We have at least an hour before us,</q> he remarked,
   <q class="sw-quote">for they can hardly take any steps until the good
      pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they
      do their work the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at present,
      Doctorâas no doubt you have divinedâin the cellar of the City branch of one of the
      principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will
      explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should
      take a considerable interest in this cellar at present.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">It is our French gold,</q> whispered the director.
   <q class="male-quote">We have had several warnings that an attempt might
      be made upon it.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Your French gold?</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our
      resources and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France.
      It
      has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it
      is
      still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons
      packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present
      than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the directors have had
      misgivings upon the subject.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Which were very well justified,</q> observed Holmes.
   <q class="sw-quote">And now it is time that we arranged our little
      plans. I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr.
      Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">And sit in the dark?</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my
      pocket, and I thought that, as we were a _partie carrÃ©e_, you might have your rubber
      after all. But I see that the enemy's preparations have gone so far that we cannot
      risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must choose our positions. These
      are daring men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us some
      harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal
      yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If
      they fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.</q></p>
<p><span class="sw-action">I placed my revolver, cocked, upon
      the top of the wooden case</span> behind which I crouched. <span class="sw-action">Holmes shot the slide across the
      front of his lantern</span> and left us in pitch darknessâsuch an absolute
   darkness as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure
   us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment's notice. To me,
   with
   my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and
   subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">They have but one retreat,</q> whispered Holmes.
   <q class="sw-quote">That is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg
      Square. I hope that you have done what I asked you, Jones?</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote"><span class="male" title="peterJones">I have
         an inspector and two officers waiting</span> at the front door.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be
      silent and wait.</q></p>
<p>What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter,
   yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone, and the dawn be breaking
   above us. My limbs were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my
   nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute
   that
   I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish
   the
   deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank
   director. From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor.
   Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.</p>
<p>At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it lengthened out
   until
   it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to
   open
   and a hand appeared, a white, <span class="male" title="vincentSpaulding">almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre</span> of
   the little area of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers,
   protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and
   all
   was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones.</p>
<p>Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing sound, one
   of the
   broad, white stones turned over upon its side and left a square, gaping hole, through
   which streamed the light of a lantern. Over the edge there <span class="male" title="vincentSpaulding">peeped a clean-cut, boyish face</span>,
   which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the aperture,
   <span class="male" title="vincentSpaulding">drew itself shoulder-high
      and waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge</span>. In another instant
   <span class="male" title="vincentSpaulding">he stood at the side
      of the hole and was hauling after him a companion</span>, lithe and small like
   himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.</p>
<p><q class="male-quote">It's all clear,</q> he whispered. <q class="male-quote">Have you the chisel and the bags? Great Scott! Jump,
      Archie, jump, and I'll swing for it!</q></p>
<p><span class="sw-action">Sherlock Holmes had sprung out
      and seized the intruder by the collar</span>. The other dived down the hole, and I
   heard the sound of rending cloth as <span class="male" title="peterJones">Jones clutched at his skirts</span>. The light flashed upon the barrel
   of a revolver, but <span class="sw-action">Holmes'
      hunting crop came down</span> on the man's wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the
   stone floor.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">It's no use, John Clay,</q> said Holmes blandly.
   <q class="sw-quote">You have no chance at all.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">So I see,</q> the other answered with the utmost
   coolness. <q class="male-quote">I fancy that my pal is all right, though I
      see you have got his coat-tails.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">There are three men waiting for him at the door,</q>
   said Holmes.</p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very
      completely. I must compliment you.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">And I you,</q> Holmes answered. <q class="sw-quote">Your red-headed idea was very new and
      effective.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">You'll see your pal again presently,</q> said Jones.
   <q class="male-quote">He's quicker at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold
      out while I fix the derbies.</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy
      hands,</q> remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists.
   <q class="male-quote">You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my
      veins. Have the goodness, also, when you address me always to say 'sir' and
      'please.'</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">All right,</q> said Jones with a stare and a snigger.
   <q class="male-quote">Well, would you please, sir, march upstairs, where we
      can get a cab to carry your Highness to the police-station?</q></p>
<p><q class="male-quote">That is better,</q> said John Clay serenely.
   <span class="male" title="vincentSpaulding">He made a sweeping
      bow to the three of us and walked quietly off</span> in the custody of the
   detective.</p>
<p><q class="male-quote">Really, Mr. Holmes,</q> said Mr. Merryweather as we
   followed them from the cellar, <q class="male-quote">I do not know how the
      bank can thank you or repay you. There is no doubt that you have detected and
      defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank
      robbery that have ever come within my experience.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle
      with Mr. John Clay,</q> said Holmes. <q class="sw-quote">I have been
      at some small expense over this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but
      beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways
      unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed
      League.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">You see, Watson,</q> he explained in the early hours
   of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, <q class="sw-quote">it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only
      possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the
      League, and the copying of the _EncyclopÃ¦dia_, must be to get this not over-bright
      pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of
      managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was
      no doubt suggested to Clay's ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice's hair.
      The Â£ 4 a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were
      playing for thousands? <span class="male" title="vincentSpaulding, duncanRoss">They put in the
         advertisement</span>, <span class="male" title="duncanRoss">one
         rogue has the temporary office</span>, <span class="male" title="vincentSpaulding">the other rogue incites the man to
         apply</span> for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every
      morning in the week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for
      half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the
      situation.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">But how could you guess what the motive was?</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Had there been women in the house, I should have
      suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man's
      business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for
      such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then,
      be something out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant's
      fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar!
      There was the end of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious
      assistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring
      criminals in London. He was doing something in the cellarâsomething which took many
      hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once more? I could think of nothing
      save that <span class="male" title="vincentSpaulding">he was running a tunnel</span> to
      some other building.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of
      action. I surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was
      ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It was not in
      front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it. We have had
      some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked
      at his face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked
      how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of burrowing.
      The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I walked round the
      corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our friend's premises, and felt
      that I had solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I called upon
      Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you
      have seen.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">And how could you tell that they would make their attempt
      to-night?</q> I asked.</p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">Well, when they closed their League offices that was a
      sign that they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson's presenceâin other words,
      that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they should use it
      soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed. Saturday would
      suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days for their
      escape. For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">You reasoned it out beautifully,</q> I exclaimed in
   unfeigned admiration. <q class="sw-quote">It is so long a chain, and yet every
      link rings true.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">It saved me from ennui,</q> he answered, yawning.
   <q class="sw-quote">Alas! I already feel it closing in upon me. My life
      is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence. These
      little problems help me to do so.</q></p>
<p><q class="sw-quote">And you are a benefactor of the race,</q> said I.</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders. <q class="sw-quote">Well, perhaps, after all, it
      is of some little use,</q> he remarked. <q class="sw-quote">'_L'homme c'est rienâl'Åuvre c'est tout_,' as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George
      Sand.</q></p>
