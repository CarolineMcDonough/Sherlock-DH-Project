<p>There was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and by the measured
      tapping of Sherlock Holmes' finger-tips upon the edge of the table. Then my
      friend rose and threw open the door.</p>
<p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Get out!</q> said he.</p>
<p><q class="jamesRyder">What, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!</q></p>
<p><q class="sherlockHolmes">No more words. Get out!</q></p>
<p>And no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon the stairs, the
      bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the
      street.</p>
<p><q class="sherlockHolmes">After all, Watson,</q> said Holmes, reaching
      up his hand for his clay pipe, <q class="sherlockHolmes">I am not
            retained by the police to supply their deficiencies. If Horner were
            in danger it would be another thing; but this fellow will not appear
            against him, and the case must collapse. I suppose that I am
            commuting a felony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul.
            This fellow will not go wrong again; he is too terribly frightened.
            Send him to gaol now, and you make him a gaol-bird for life.
            Besides, it is the season of forgiveness. Chance has put in our way
            a most singular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its own
            reward. If you will have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we
            will begin another investigation, in which, also a bird will be the
            chief feature.</q></p>`;
