      <h2 id="story-selection">Story Selection</h2>
      <p>We chose our set of stories for this project by examining the available Project Gutenberg
         texts and selecting the collection of stories that seemed most reasonable to mark upâ€” a
         group of short (and therefore manageable) stories, already collected into a single book. We
         then split the stories among ourselves and marked them up according to the methodology
         listed below.</p>
      <h2 id="markup-methods">Markup Methods</h2>
      <p>In order to determine the perceived agency of characters in our selected stories, we
         examined two metrics: the number of words a character said, and the number of actions they
         performed.</p>
      <p>After adding in the requisite structural tags (chapters,t paragraphs, and the like), we
         marked up our texts by:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Using regular expressions to locate quotes (based on pairs of single or double quotes
            with text between them) and replace the &quot; or &#39; with <code>&lt;q&gt;</code>
            tags</li>
         <li>Adding <code>@speaker</code> elements to each quote with the name of the character
            speaking</li>
         <li>Manually reading and locating actions in the text<ul>
               <li>For more information about how we determined what qualified as an action, visit
                     <a href="https://github.com/CarolineMcDonough/Sherlock-DH-Project/issues/8"
                     >this issue on our github</a>.</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>Locating the name or pronoun of the character performing the action and wrapping it in
            a <code>&lt;char&gt;</code> tag with attributes for the <code>@name</code> and
               <code>@gender</code> of the character</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         <em>Though our original research question called for additional markup denoting the
            alignment of a character, we decided to forgo that step in favor of focusing on the
            markup we kept.</em>
