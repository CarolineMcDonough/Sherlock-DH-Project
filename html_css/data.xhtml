        <h2>Total Number of Actions Executed by Each Gender</h2>
        <p class="glassBorder">
            We begin the analysis of our research with this first graph portraying the number of actions taken on by
            each gender.
            The graph applies to the collection of stories we analyzed as a whole. We also decided to include a separate
            category
            for Holmes and Watson, separate from the male category, since they play such a large role in each of the
            stories. Their
            roles as main characters nearly guarantee both characters a great deal of agency, so it would not be far to
            count them
            with the rest of the male characters, especially in comparison to the female category which does not include
            any recurring
            main characters.

        </p>
        <h2>Total Word Count Spoken By Each Gender</h2>
        <p class="glassBorder">
            Next, we have utilized our data to create a graph conveying the total spoken word count of each gender over
            the course of
            multiple stories. Again, we have placed Holmes and Watson in their own category since they, as main
            characters, are almost
            guaranteed many lines of dialogue. We have decided to use word count rather than merely counting the number
            of quotes from
            each gender because it is not uncommon to read long paragraphs of dialogue from a character; however, these
            paragraphs would
            only count as one quote, which is not giving the character as much credit for their agency as they deserve,
            especially in
            comparison to a character who may speak multiple times but only answers in short responses.
            As the chart shows, Holmes and Watson have the highest word count. This is irreleveant to our conclusion
            though.
            Instead we should focus on the apparent stark difference between male and female word count. The analysis
            has
            determined that men spoke almost four times as many words as the female characters.
        <figure class="pie-chart">
            <h3>Quote word count</h3>
            <p>31.2%</p>
            <p>8.5%</p>
            <p>60.3%</p>

        <h2>Average Number of Actions Executed by Each Member of Each Gender</h2>
        <p class="glassBorder">
            Finally, this graph displays the average number of actions done by each female, as well as for each male. We
            did not include
            Holmes and Watson in this graph because their data is not relevant to the graph or our research question,
            and may, in fact,
            throw it off. The average number of actions done by each character of each gender was found by taking the
            numbers seen in the
            first graph, (the total number of actions executed by all characters of each gender over the course of
            multiple stories), and
            dividing it by the number of characters presented of each gender.
