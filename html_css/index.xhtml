        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p class="glassBorder">
        <p>This project set out to analyze a portion of the Sherlock Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
            with the intent of discovering the relative agency of side characters within the stories.</p>
        <p class="bold">To that end, our main research questions were as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>What is the ratio of the number of words spoken by female characters to the number spoken by male
                characters (including Holmes and Watson, who naturally appear and speak in every story?</li>
            <li>What is the ratio of actions taken between the genders, where an action is defined as any effort
                intentionally undertaken by a character <em>excluding speech or other vocalizations</em>. Naturally,
                Holmes and Watson would be excluded from data processing for this question as well.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <h2>About the Developers</h2>
        <p class="glassBorder aboutTheDevelopers">

        <span>Sean Shmulevich: </span>
        <p>is a senior majoring in Computer Science. He took this class to apply his knowledge of computer science to
            the humanities and work an an interdisciplinary context. He was surprised how of how much best practices for
            software development were taught and enforced thoughout this class.</p>
        <span>Alyssa Underwood: </span>
        <p>is a freshman majoring in Communications. She took this course to fulfill the quantitative reasoning general
            education requirement, and has learned a lot more than she expected to along the way.</p>

        <p>is a sophomore majoring in digital narrative and interactive design, he took this class to explore the
            intersection of the humanities and technology. He has never broken a bone, and is grateful for the lessons
            he has learned in collective coordination through this project </p>

        <span>Special thanks</span>
        <p>to our mentor Camryn Dorney and our professor David Birnbaum for their guidance throughout
