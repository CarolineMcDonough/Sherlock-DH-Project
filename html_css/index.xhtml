        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p class="glassBorder">
        <p>This project set out to analyze a portion of the Sherlock Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
            with the intent of discovering the relative agency of side characters within the stories.</p>
        <p>To that end, our main research questions were as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>What is the ratio of the number of words spoken by female characters to the number spoken by male
                characters (including Holmes and Watson, who naturally appear and speak in every story?</li>
            <li>What is the ratio of actions taken between the genders, where an action is defined as any effort
                intentionally undertaken by a character <em>excluding speech or other vocalizations</em>. Naturally,
                Holmes and Watson would be excluded from data processing for this question as well.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
