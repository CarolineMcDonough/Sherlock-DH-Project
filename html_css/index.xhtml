        <h1 class="paraHeader">Overview</h1>
        <p class="mainParagraph">This project analyzes linguistic ellipsis
            (elision) present in 90 poems written by Emily Dickinson. More specifically, we sought to analyze the
            correlation between elision and other factors, such as imagery, themes, recipients, and the time period in
            which the poems were written.

            Our main research questions:

            What types of ellipsis and imagery are most commonplace in Dickinson's poems?
            How does ellipsis correlate with other factors associated with her poems, such as date written, recipients,
            and imagery?
            Through our markup and analysis of these poems using XML-based technologies, we were able to generate some
            answers to these questions and even some new ideas. Explore our website to find out more!</p>
