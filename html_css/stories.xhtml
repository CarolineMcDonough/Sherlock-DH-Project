                <h2>The Story of Stories</h2>
                <p>
        
        Mrs. Hudson, the landlady of Sherlock Holmes, was a long-suffering
        woman.  Not only was her first-floor flat invaded at all hours by
        throngs of singular and often undesirable characters but her remarkable
        lodger showed an eccentricity and irregularity in his life which must
        have sorely tried her patience. His incredible untidiness, his
        addiction to music at strange hours, his occasional revolver practice
        within doors, his weird and often malodorous scientific experiments,
        and the atmosphere of violence and danger which hung around him made
        him the very worst tenant in London.  On the other hand, his payments
        were princely. I have no doubt that the house might have been purchased
        at the price which Holmes paid for his rooms during the years that I
        was with him.
        
        The landlady stood in the deepest awe of him and never dared to
        interfere with him, however outrageous his proceedings might seem.  She
        was fond of him, too, for he had a remarkable gentleness and courtesy
        in his dealings with women.  He disliked and distrusted the sex, but he
        was always a chivalrous opponent. Knowing how genuine was her regard
        for him, I listened earnestly to her story when she came to my rooms in
        the second year of my married life and told me of the sad condition to
        which my poor friend was reduced.
        
        "He's dying, Dr. Watson," said she.  "For three days he has been
        sinking, and I doubt if he will last the day.  He would not let me get
        a doctor.  This morning when I saw his bones sticking out of his face
        and his great bright eyes looking at me I could stand no more of it.
        'With your leave or without it, Mr. Holmes, I am going for a doctor
        this very hour,' said I.  'Let it be Watson, then,' said he.  I
        wouldn't waste an hour in coming to him, sir, or you may not see him
        alive."
        
        I was horrified for I had heard nothing of his illness.  I need not say
        that I rushed for my coat and my hat.  As we drove back I asked for the
        details.
        
        "There is little I can tell you, sir.  He has been working at a case
        down at Rotherhithe, in an alley near the river, and he has brought
        this illness back with him.  He took to his bed on Wednesday afternoon
        and has never moved since.  For these three days neither food nor drink
        has passed his lips."
        
        "Good God!  Why did you not call in a doctor?"
        
        "He wouldn't have it, sir.  You know how masterful he is.  I didn't
        dare to disobey him.  But he's not long for this world, as you'll see
        for yourself the moment that you set eyes on him."
