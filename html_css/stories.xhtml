            <h2>The Story of Stories</h2>
            <p style="padding:40px;text-align: left;">
    
    Mrs. Hudson, the landlady of Sherlock Holmes, was a long-suffering
    woman.  Not only was her first-floor flat invaded at all hours by
    throngs of singular and often undesirable characters but her remarkable
    lodger showed an eccentricity and irregularity in his life which must
    have sorely tried her patience. His incredible untidiness, his
    addiction to music at strange hours, his occasional revolver practice
    within doors, his weird and often malodorous scientific experiments,
    and the atmosphere of violence and danger which hung around him made
    him the very worst tenant in London.  On the other hand, his payments
    were princely. I have no doubt that the house might have been purchased
    at the price which Holmes paid for his rooms during the years that I
    was with him.
    
    The landlady stood in the deepest awe of him and never dared to
    interfere with him, however outrageous his proceedings might seem.  She
    was fond of him, too, for he had a remarkable gentleness and courtesy
    in his dealings with women.  He disliked and distrusted the sex, but he
    was always a chivalrous opponent. Knowing how genuine was her regard
    for him, I listened earnestly to her story when she came to my rooms in
    the second year of my married life and told me of the sad condition to
    which my poor friend was reduced.
    
    "He's dying, Dr. Watson," said she.  "For three days he has been
    sinking, and I doubt if he will last the day.  He would not let me get
    a doctor.  This morning when I saw his bones sticking out of his face
    and his great bright eyes looking at me I could stand no more of it.
    'With your leave or without it, Mr. Holmes, I am going for a doctor
    this very hour,' said I.  'Let it be Watson, then,' said he.  I
    wouldn't waste an hour in coming to him, sir, or you may not see him
    alive."
    
    I was horrified for I had heard nothing of his illness.  I need not say
    that I rushed for my coat and my hat.  As we drove back I asked for the
    details.
    
    "There is little I can tell you, sir.  He has been working at a case
    down at Rotherhithe, in an alley near the river, and he has brought
    this illness back with him.  He took to his bed on Wednesday afternoon
    and has never moved since.  For these three days neither food nor drink
    has passed his lips."
    
    "Good God!  Why did you not call in a doctor?"
    
    "He wouldn't have it, sir.  You know how masterful he is.  I didn't
    dare to disobey him.  But he's not long for this world, as you'll see
    for yourself the moment that you set eyes on him."
    
    He was indeed a deplorable spectacle.  In the dim light of a foggy
    November day the sick room was a gloomy spot, but it was that gaunt,
    wasted face staring at me from the bed which sent a chill to my heart.
    His eyes had the brightness of fever, there was a hectic flush upon
    either cheek, and dark crusts clung to his lips; the thin hands upon
    the coverlet twitched incessantly, his voice was croaking and
    spasmodic.  He lay listlessly as I entered the room, but the sight of
    me brought a gleam of recognition to his eyes.
    
    "Well, Watson, we seem to have fallen upon evil days," said he in a
    feeble voice, but with something of his old carelessness of manner.
    
    "My dear fellow!" I cried, approaching him.
    
    "Stand back!  Stand right back!" said he with the sharp imperiousness
    which I had associated only with moments of crisis. "If you approach
    me, Watson, I shall order you out of the house."
    
    "But why?"
    
    "Because it is my desire.  Is that not enough?"
    
    Yes, Mrs. Hudson was right.  He was more masterful than ever.  It was
    pitiful, however, to see his exhaustion.
    
    "I only wished to help," I explained.
    
    "Exactly!  You will help best by doing what you are told."
    
    "Certainly, Holmes."
    
    He relaxed the austerity of his manner.
    
    "You are not angry?" he asked, gasping for breath.
    
    Poor devil, how could I be angry when I saw him lying in such a plight
    before me?
    
    "It's for your own sake, Watson," he croaked.
