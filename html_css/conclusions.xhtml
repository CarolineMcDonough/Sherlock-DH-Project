        <h1>Conclusions</h1>
        <h2>Findings and Significance</h2>
        <p class="glassBorder">
            Our research question was “How often are characters of each gender given agency?”. Based on the time period
            in which Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote these stories,
            in which men often took on a more active role in society and women were expected to be silent supporters, we
            hypothesized that men would be given more agency,
            and that would be shown through a greater number of actions and more spoken words than female characters.
            After our research and analysis, we have concluded that
            our hypothesis was correct – men do, in fact, possess more agency than their female counterparts. 
            <p>
                This research is important because it confirms our ideas we hold today of how society functioned in the late
                nineteenth century. It can be assumed that Doyle wrote
                fewer female characters with lesser amounts of agency than men because it wasn’t prevalent enough in his own
                community to be comprehensible or sufficiently realistic
                to his readers. The stories are fiction, but there is a component of reality that brings them to life.</p>
            </p>
        <h3>Fascinating Finds</h3>
        <p class="glassBorder">While reading and marking up the corpus, we happened to notice an interesting
            commonality. We have concluded that Doyle doesn’t present female characters as often as male
            characters; however, when he does, he writes in a conversation between Holmes and Watson in which they
            discuss their bewilderment that a female could be so strong and independent.
            This is perhaps so noticeable because such a conversation is never held about any male character, likely
            since women at the time were thought to be in perpetual need of protection
            by men. </p>
        <p class="glassBorder">Furthermore, we noticed that Doyle refers to the “womanly instinct” quite often. Many of
            his female characters credit their success in dealing with tense situations to their
            “womanly instincts”. In addition, Holmes and Watson often credit female successes to “womanly instincts”, as
            well. This was interesting because Doyle credited male success
            to their intelligence, courage, and strength. At the time of its creation, these were not traits often
            associated with the female persuasion, so it might be seen as strange
            to the readers at the time of publication that Doyle would describe female characters in such a way. Women,
            even today, are said to have a maternal instinct, which some believe
            makes women better caretakers for children than men and to them, rationalizing the expectation that they
            will stay home and take care of children while men go out into the world
            away from their offspring. It can be inferred that the maternal instinct is not far off from Doyle’s
            so-called “womanly instinct”, crediting her gender more than her as a person.
        </p>
        <h4>The End</h4>
        <p class="glassBorder">Throughout this project, we have been able to determine, through detailed markup of
            actions and spoken word count, that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle gives his male characters a more
            active role, or more agency, within each story than his female characters, if he even features one at all.
            This conclusion is likely indicative of the societal standards and
            expectations of the time period in which the Sherlock Holmes collection was published, as we predicted in
            our hypothesis. If we had more time, we would have utilized more stories,
            which would have likely further proved our hypothesis. Additionally, we would have looked at the alliances
            characters of each gender tend to take, in terms of whether they seem
            to side with Sherlock Holmes or not, as we expressed in our original research question. We had limited time
            and weren’t able to execute all we initially planned on doing, but we
            are proud of the work that was done.
