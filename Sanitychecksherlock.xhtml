      <h3>Story</h3>
      <p><span class="male" title="johnWatson">I had called upon my friend
            Sherlock Holmes</span> upon the second morning after Christmas,
         with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season.
         <span class="male" title="sherlockHolmes">He
            was lounging upon the sofa</span> in a purple dressing-gown, a
         pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled morning
         papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden
         chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable
         hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several places. A
         lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat
         had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination.</p>
      <p><q class="johnWatson">You are engaged,</q> said I; <q class="johnWatson">perhaps I interrupt you.</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom
            I can discuss my results. The matter is a perfectly trivial
            one</q>—he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old
         hat—<q class="sherlockHolmes">but there are points in
            connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and
            even of instruction.</q></p>
      <p><span class="male" title="johnWatson">I seated myself in his
            armchair</span> and warmed my hands before his crackling fire, for
         a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were thick with the ice crystals.
         <q class="johnWatson">I suppose,</q> I remarked, <q class="johnWatson">that, homely as it looks, this thing has some
            deadly story linked on to it—that it is the clue which will guide
            you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some
            crime.</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">No, no. No crime,</q> said Sherlock Holmes,
         laughing. <q class="sherlockHolmes">Only one of those whimsical little
            incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings
            all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles. Amid
            the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity, every
            possible combination of events may be expected to take place, and
            many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and
            bizarre without being criminal. We have already had experience of
            such.</q></p>
      <p><q class="johnWatson">So much so,</q> I remarked, <q class="johnWatson">that of the last six cases which I have added
            to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal
            crime.</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover
            the Irene Adler papers, to the singular case of Miss Mary
            Sutherland, and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip.
            Well, I have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same
            innocent category. You know Peterson, the
            commissionaire?</q></p>
      <p><q class="johnWatson">Yes.</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">It is to him that this trophy
            belongs.</q></p>
      <p><q class="johnWatson">It is his hat.</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">No, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg
            that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an
            intellectual problem. And, first, as to how it came here. It arrived
            upon Christmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is,
            I have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of Peterson's
            fire. The facts are these: about four o'clock on Christmas morning,
            Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was returning
            from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down
            Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a
            tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white
            goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the corner of Goodge
            Street, a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of
            roughs. One of the latter knocked off the man's hat, on which he
            raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging it over his head,
            smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson had rushed forward to
            protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at
            having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in
            uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels,
            and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the
            back of Tottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the
            appearance of Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the
            field of battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of
            this battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas
            goose.</q></p>
      <p><q class="johnWatson">Which surely he restored to their owner?</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is
            true that 'For Mrs. Henry Baker' was printed upon a small card which
            was tied to the bird's left leg, and it is also true that the
            initials 'H. B.' are legible upon the lining of this hat, but as
            there are some thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry
            Bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property
            to any one of them.</q></p>
      <p><q class="johnWatson">What, then, did Peterson do?</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes"><span class="male" title="commissionairePeterson">He brought
               round both hat and goose to me on Christmas
               morning</span>, knowing that even the smallest problems are of
            interest to me. The goose we retained until this morning, when there
            were signs that, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that
            it should be eaten without unnecessary delay. <span class="male" title="commissionairePeterson">Its
               finder has carried it off</span>,
            therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while I
            continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his
            Christmas dinner.</q></p>
      <p><q class="johnWatson">Did he not advertise?</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">No.</q></p>
      <p><q class="johnWatson">Then, what clue could you have as to his
            identity?</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Only as much as we can deduce.</q></p>
      <p><q class="johnWatson">From his hat?</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Precisely.</q></p>
      <p><q class="johnWatson">But you are joking. What can you gather from this old
            battered felt?</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can
            you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn
            this article?</q></p>
      <p>I took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully. It was
         a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape, hard and much the worse
         for wear. The lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal discoloured.
         There was no maker's name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials "H. B."
         were scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for a hat-securer,
         but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly
         dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seemed to have been
         some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.</p>
      <p><q class="johnWatson">I can see nothing,</q> said I, handing it back to
         my friend.</p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything.
            You fail, however, to reason from what you see. You are too timid in
            drawing your inferences.</q></p>
      <p><q class="johnWatson">Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from
            this hat?</q></p>
      <p><span class="male" title="sherlockHolmes">He picked it up and
            gazed at it</span> in the peculiar introspective fashion which was
         characteristic of him. <q class="sherlockHolmes">It is perhaps less
            suggestive than it might have been,</q> he remarked, <q class="sherlockHolmes">and yet there are a few inferences which
            are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a
            strong balance of probability. That the man was highly intellectual
            is of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was
            fairly well-to-do within the last three years, although he has now
            fallen upon evil days. He had foresight, but has less now than
            formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with
            the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence,
            probably drink, at work upon him. This may account also for the
            obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him.</q></p>
      <p><q class="johnWatson">My dear Holmes!</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">He has, however, retained some degree of
            self-respect,</q> he continued, disregarding my remonstrance.
         <q class="sherlockHolmes">He is a man who leads a sedentary
            life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged,
            has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and
            which he anoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts
            which are to be deduced from his hat. Also, by the way, that it is
            extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his
            house.</q></p>
      <p><q class="johnWatson">You are certainly joking, Holmes.</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Not in the least. Is it possible that even now,
            when I give you these results, you are unable to see how they are
            attained?</q></p>
      <p><q class="johnWatson">I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must
            confess that I am unable to follow you. For example, how did you
            deduce that this man was intellectual?</q></p>
      <p>For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the forehead
         and settled upon the bridge of his nose. <q class="sherlockHolmes">It
            is a question of cubic capacity,</q> said he; <q class="sherlockHolmes">a man with so large a brain must have
            something in it.</q></p>
      <p><q class="johnWatson">The decline of his fortunes, then?</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">This hat is three years old. These flat brims
            curled at the edge came in then. It is a hat of the very best
            quality. Look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining.
            If this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago,
            and has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the
            world.</q></p>
      <p><q class="johnWatson">Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about
            the foresight and the moral retrogression?</q></p>
      <p>Sherlock Holmes laughed. <q class="sherlockHolmes">Here is the
            foresight,</q> said he putting his finger upon the little disc
         and loop of the hat-securer. <q class="sherlockHolmes">They are never
            sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain
            amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this
            precaution against the wind. But since we see that he has broken the
            elastic and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he
            has less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a
            weakening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal
            some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which
            is a sign that he has not entirely lost his
            self-respect.</q></p>
      <p><q class="johnWatson">Your reasoning is certainly plausible.</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">The further points, that he is middle-aged, that
            his hair is grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he
            uses lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of
            the lower part of the lining. The lens discloses a large number of
            hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all appear
            to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream. This
            dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey dust of the street
            but the fluffy brown dust of the house, showing that it has been
            hung up indoors most of the time, while the marks of moisture upon
            the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely,
            and could therefore, hardly be in the best of training.</q></p>
      <p><q class="johnWatson">But his wife—you said that she had ceased to love
            him.</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I
            see you, my dear Watson, with a week's accumulation of dust upon
            your hat, and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I
            shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your
            wife's affection.</q></p>
      <p><q class="johnWatson">But he might be a bachelor.</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a
            peace-offering to his wife. Remember the card upon the bird's
            leg.</q></p>
      <p><q class="johnWatson">You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do
            you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house?</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">One tallow stain, or even two, might come by
            chance; but when I see no less than five, I think that there can be
            little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent
            contact with burning tallow—walks upstairs at night probably with
            his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he
            never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you
            satisfied?</q></p>
      <p><q class="johnWatson">Well, it is very ingenious,</q> said I, laughing;
         <q class="johnWatson">but since, as you said just now, there
            has been no crime committed, and no harm done save the loss of a
            goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy.</q></p>
      <p>Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open, and
         <span class="male" title="commissionairePeterson">Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the
            apartment</span> with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is
         dazed with astonishment.</p>
      <p><q class="commissionairePeterson">The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose,
            sir!</q> he gasped.</p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Eh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and
            flapped off through the kitchen window?</q> Holmes twisted
         himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the man's excited
         face.</p>
      <p><q class="commissionairePeterson">See here, sir! See what my wife found in
            its crop!</q>
         <span class="male" title="commissionairePeterson">He held out
            his hand and displayed</span> upon the centre of the palm a
         brilliantly scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size,
         but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in
         the dark hollow of his hand.</p>
      <p><span class="male" title="sherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes sat
            up</span> with a whistle. <q class="sherlockHolmes">By Jove,
            Peterson!</q> said he, <q class="sherlockHolmes">this is
            treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you have
            got?</q></p>
      <p><q class="commissionairePeterson">A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts
            into glass as though it were putty.</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">It's more than a precious stone. It is _the_
            precious stone.</q></p>
      <p><q class="johnWatson">Not the Countess of Morcar's blue carbuncle!</q>
         I ejaculated.</p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape,
            seeing that I have read the advertisement about it in _The Times_
            every day lately. It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be
            conjectured, but the reward offered of £ 1000 is certainly not
            within a twentieth part of the market price.</q></p>
      <p><q class="commissionairePeterson">A thousand pounds! Great Lord of
            mercy!</q>
         <span class="male" title="commissionairePeterson">The commissionaire plumped down into a chair</span>
         and stared from one to the other of us.</p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">That is the reward, and I have reason to know
            that there are sentimental considerations in the background which
            would induce the Countess to part with half her fortune if she could
            but recover the gem.</q></p>
      <p><q class="johnWatson">It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel
            Cosmopolitan,</q> I remarked.</p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days
            ago. John Horner, a plumber, was accused of having abstracted it
            from the lady's jewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong
            that the case has been referred to the Assizes. I have some account
            of the matter here, I believe.</q>
         <span class="male" title="sherlockHolmes">He rummaged amid
            his newspapers, glancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed
            one out,</span> doubled it over, and read the following
         paragraph:</p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner,
            26, plumber, was brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd
            inst., abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the
            valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle. James Ryder,
            upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the effect that
            he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess of
            Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the
            second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had remained with
            Horner some little time, but had finally been called away. On
            returning, he found that Horner had disappeared, that the bureau had
            been forced open, and that the small morocco casket in which, as it
            afterwards transpired, the Countess was accustomed to keep her
            jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table. Ryder instantly gave
            the alarm, and Horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone
            could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine
            Cusack, maid to the Countess, deposed to having heard Ryder's cry of
            dismay on discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the
            room, where she found matters as described by the last witness.
            Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of
            Horner, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence in
            the strongest terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery
            having been given against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to
            deal summarily with the offence, but referred it to the Assizes.
            Horner, who had shown signs of intense emotion during the
            proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of
            court.</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Hum! So much for the police-court,</q> said
         Holmes thoughtfully, tossing aside the paper. <q class="sherlockHolmes">The question for us now to solve is the
            sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to
            the crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You see,
            Watson, our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more
            important and less innocent aspect. Here is the stone; the stone
            came from the goose, and the goose came from Mr. Henry Baker, the
            gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with
            which I have bored you. So now we must set ourselves very seriously
            to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played
            in this little mystery. To do this, we must try the simplest means
            first, and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the
            evening papers. If this fail, I shall have recourse to other
            methods.</q></p>
      <p><q class="johnWatson">What will you say?</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now,
            then: 'Found at the corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black
            felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this
            evening at 221B, Baker Street.' That is clear and
            concise.</q></p>
      <p><q class="johnWatson">Very. But will he see it?</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers,
            since, to a poor man, the loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so
            scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach
            of Peterson that he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he
            must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop
            his bird. Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him
            to see it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to
            it. Here you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency and
            have this put in the evening papers.</q></p>
      <p><q class="commissionairePeterson">In which, sir?</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Oh, in the _Globe_, _Star_, _Pall Mall_, _St.
            James's Gazette_, _Evening News_, _Standard_, _Echo_, and any others
            that occur to you.</q></p>
      <p><q class="commissionairePeterson">Very well, sir. And this
            stone?</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And,
            I say, Peterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here
            with me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of
            the one which your family is now devouring.</q></p>
      <p>When the commissionaire had gone, <span class="male" title="sherlockHolmes">Holmes took up the stone and
            held it against the light.</span>
         <q class="sherlockHolmes">It's a bonny thing,</q> said he. <q class="sherlockHolmes">Just see how it glints and sparkles. Of
            course it is a nucleus and focus of crime. Every good stone is. They
            are the devil's pet baits. In the larger and older jewels every
            facet may stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty
            years old. It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in southern
            China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the
            carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red. In
            spite of its youth, it has already a sinister history. There have
            been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several
            robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of
            crystallised charcoal. Who would think that so pretty a toy would be
            a purveyor to the gallows and the prison? I'll lock it up in my
            strong box now and drop a line to the Countess to say that we have
            it.</q></p>
      <p><q class="johnWatson">Do you think that this man Horner is
            innocent?</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">I cannot tell.</q></p>
      <p><q class="johnWatson">Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry
            Baker, had anything to do with the matter?</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker
            is an absolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which
            he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made
            of solid gold. That, however, I shall determine by a very simple
            test if we have an answer to our advertisement.</q></p>
      <p><q class="johnWatson">And you can do nothing until then?</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Nothing.</q></p>
      <p><q class="johnWatson">In that case I shall continue my professional round.
            But I shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned,
            for I should like to see the solution of so tangled a
            business.</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a
            woodcock, I believe. By the way, in view of recent occurrences,
            perhaps I ought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop.</q></p>
      <p>I had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six when
         <span class="male" title="johnWatson">I found
            myself in Baker Street</span> once more. As <span class="male" title="johnWatson">I approached the
            house</span> I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which
         was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which
         was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I arrived the door was opened, and we
         were shown up together to Holmes' room.</p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Mr. Henry Baker, I believe,</q> said
         <span class="male" title="sherlockHolmes">he,
            rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor</span> with the
         easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume. <q class="sherlockHolmes">Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr.
            Baker. It is a cold night, and I observe that your circulation is
            more adapted for summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have just
            come at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?</q></p>
      <p><q class="henryBaker">Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.</q></p>
      <p>He was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad,
         intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. A touch
         of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended hand,
         recalled Holmes' surmise as to his habits. His rusty black frock-coat was
         buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists
         protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a
         slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the impression
         generally of a man of learning and letters who had had ill-usage at the
         hands of fortune.</p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">We have retained these things for some
            days,</q> said Holmes, <q class="sherlockHolmes">because
            we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. I
            am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise.</q></p>
      <p>Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. <q class="henryBaker">Shillings
            have not been so plentiful with me as they once were,</q> he
         remarked. <q class="henryBaker">I had no doubt that the gang of roughs
            who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird. I did not
            care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering
            them.</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we
            were compelled to eat it.</q></p>
      <p><q class="henryBaker">To eat it!</q>
         <span class="male" title="henryBaker">Our visitor half rose
            from his chair</span> in his excitement.</p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had
            we not done so. But I presume that this other goose upon the
            sideboard, which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will
            answer your purpose equally well?</q></p>
      <p><q class="henryBaker">Oh, certainly, certainly,</q> answered Mr. Baker
         with a sigh of relief.</p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Of course, we still have the feathers, legs,
            crop, and so on of your own bird, so if you wish—</q></p>
      <p>The man burst into a hearty laugh. <q class="henryBaker">They might be
            useful to me as relics of my adventure,</q> said he, <q class="henryBaker">but beyond that I can hardly see what use the
            _disjecta membra_ of my late acquaintance are going to be to me. No,
            sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my
            attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the
            sideboard.</q></p>
      <p><span class="male" title="sherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes glanced
            sharply across at me</span> with a slight shrug of his
         shoulders.</p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">There is your hat, then, and there your
            bird,</q> said he. <q class="sherlockHolmes">By the way,
            would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I am
            somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown
            goose.</q></p>
      <p><q class="henryBaker">Certainly, sir,</q> said <span class="male" title="henryBaker">Baker, who had risen
            and tucked his newly gained property under his arm</span>. <q class="henryBaker">There are a few of us who frequent the Alpha
            Inn, near the Museum—we are to be found in the Museum itself during
            the day, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name,
            instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few
            pence every week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas. My
            pence were duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. I am much
            indebted to you, sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my
            years nor my gravity.</q> With a comical pomposity of manner
         <span class="male" title="henryBaker">he
            bowed solemnly</span> to both of us and strode off upon his
         way.</p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">So much for Mr. Henry Baker,</q> said Holmes
         when he had closed the door behind him. <q class="sherlockHolmes">It
            is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter.
            Are you hungry, Watson?</q></p>
      <p><q class="johnWatson">Not particularly.</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a
            supper and follow up this clue while it is still hot.</q></p>
      <p><q class="johnWatson">By all means.</q></p>
      <p>It was a bitter night, so <span class="male" title="sherlockHolmes, johnWatson">we drew on our
            ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats</span>. Outside, the
         stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky, and the breath of the
         passers-by blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang
         out crisply and loudly as <span class="male" title="sherlockHolmes, johnWatson">we swung through
            the doctors' quarter</span>, Wimpole Street, Harley Street, and so
         through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were
         in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn, which is a small public-house at the corner
         of one of the streets which runs down into Holborn. <span class="male" title="sherlockHolmes">Holmes pushed
            open the door</span> of the private bar and ordered two glasses of
         beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.</p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as
            your geese,</q> said he.</p>
      <p><q class="windigate">My geese!</q> The man seemed surprised.</p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Yes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr.
            Henry Baker, who was a member of your goose club.</q></p>
      <p><q class="windigate">Ah! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them's not _our_
            geese.</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Indeed! Whose, then?</q></p>
      <p><q class="windigate">Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent
            Garden.</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Indeed? I know some of them. Which was
            it?</q></p>
      <p><q class="windigate">Breckinridge is his name.</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Ah! I don't know him. Well, here's your good
            health landlord, and prosperity to your house.
            Good-night.</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Now for Mr. Breckinridge,</q> he continued,
         buttoning up his coat as we came out into the frosty air. <q class="sherlockHolmes">Remember, Watson that though we have so
            homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the
            other a man who will certainly get seven years' penal servitude
            unless we can establish his innocence. It is possible that our
            inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line
            of investigation which has been missed by the police, and which a
            singular chance has placed in our hands. Let us follow it out to the
            bitter end. Faces to the south, then, and quick march!</q></p>
      <p>We passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag of slums to
         Covent Garden Market. One of the largest stalls bore the name of
         Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor a horsey-looking man, with a sharp
         face and trim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters.</p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Good-evening. It's a cold night,</q> said
         Holmes.</p>
      <p><span class="male" title="breckinridge">The salesman nodded and
            shot a questioning glance at my companion.</span></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Sold out of geese, I see,</q> continued
         Holmes, pointing at the bare slabs of marble.</p>
      <p><q class="breckinridge">Let you have five hundred to-morrow
            morning.</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">That's no good.</q></p>
      <p><q class="breckinridge">Well, there are some on the stall with the
            gas-flare.</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Ah, but I was recommended to you.</q></p>
      <p><q class="breckinridge">Who by?</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">The landlord of the Alpha.</q></p>
      <p><q class="breckinridge">Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Fine birds they were, too. Now where did you get
            them from?</q></p>
      <p>To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman.</p>
      <p><q class="breckinridge">Now, then, mister,</q> said he, with his head
         cocked and his arms akimbo, <q class="breckinridge">what are you
            driving at? Let's have it straight, now.</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">It is straight enough. I should like to know who
            sold you the geese which you supplied to the Alpha.</q></p>
      <p><q class="breckinridge">Well then, I shan't tell you. So now!</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don't
            know why you should be so warm over such a trifle.</q></p>
      <p><q class="breckinridge">Warm! You'd be as warm, maybe, if you were as
            pestered as I am. When I pay good money for a good article there
            should be an end of the business; but it's 'Where are the geese?'
            and 'Who did you sell the geese to?' and 'What will you take for the
            geese?' One would think they were the only geese in the world, to
            hear the fuss that is made over them.</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Well, I have no connection with any other people
            who have been making inquiries,</q> said Holmes carelessly.
         <q class="sherlockHolmes">If you won't tell us the bet is off,
            that is all. But I'm always ready to back my opinion on a matter of
            fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country
            bred.</q></p>
      <p><q class="breckinridge">Well, then, you've lost your fiver, for it's town
            bred,</q> snapped the salesman.</p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">It's nothing of the kind.</q></p>
      <p><q class="breckinridge">I say it is.</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">I don't believe it.</q></p>
      <p><q class="breckinridge">D'you think you know more about fowls than I, who
            have handled them ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those
            birds that went to the Alpha were town bred.</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">You'll never persuade me to believe
            that.</q></p>
      <p><q class="breckinridge">Will you bet, then?</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">It's merely taking your money, for I know that I
            am right. But I'll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you
            not to be obstinate.</q></p>
      <p>The salesman chuckled grimly. <q class="breckinridge">Bring me the books,
            Bill,</q> said he.</p>
      <p><span class="male" title="bill">The small boy brought round a
            small thin volume and a great greasy-backed one</span>, laying
         them out together beneath the hanging lamp.</p>
      <p><q class="breckinridge">Now then, Mr. Cocksure,</q> said the salesman,
         <q class="breckinridge">I thought that I was out of geese, but
            before I finish you'll find that there is still one left in my shop.
            You see this little book?</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Well?</q></p>
      <p><q class="breckinridge">That's the list of the folk from whom I buy. D'you
            see? Well, then, here on this page are the country folk, and the
            numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big
            ledger. Now, then! You see this other page in red ink? Well, that is
            a list of my town suppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just read
            it out to me.</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road—249,</q>
         read Holmes.</p>
      <p><q class="breckinridge">Quite so. Now turn that up in the
            ledger.</q></p>
      <p><span class="male" title="sherlockHolmes">Holmes turned to the
            page</span> indicated. <q class="sherlockHolmes">Here you
            are, 'Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry
            supplier.'</q></p>
      <p><q class="breckinridge">Now, then, what's the last entry?</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">'December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7_s_.
            6_d_.'</q></p>
      <p><q class="breckinridge">Quite so. There you are. And
            underneath?</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">'Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at
            12_s_.'</q></p>
      <p><q class="breckinridge">What have you to say now?</q></p>
      <p>Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. <span class="male" title="sherlockHolmes">He drew a sovereign from his
            pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of
            a man whose disgust is too deep for words</span>. A few yards off
         he stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion
         which was peculiar to him.</p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and
            the 'Pink 'un' protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him
            by a bet,</q> said he. <q class="sherlockHolmes">I daresay
            that if I had put £ 100 down in front of him, that man would not
            have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the
            idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy,
            nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains to be
            determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott
            to-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear
            from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides
            ourselves who are anxious about the matter, and I
            should—</q></p>
      <p>His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the
         stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow
         standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the
         swinging lamp, while <span class="male" title="breckinridge">Breckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door of
            his stall, was shaking his fists</span> fiercely at the cringing
         figure.</p>
      <p><q class="breckinridge">I've had enough of you and your geese,</q> he
         shouted. <q class="breckinridge">I wish you were all at the devil
            together. If you come pestering me any more with your silly talk
            I'll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and I'll
            answer her, but what have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese off
            you?</q></p>
      <p><q class="jamesRyder">No; but one of them was mine all the same,</q>
         whined the little man.</p>
      <p><q class="breckinridge">Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.</q></p>
      <p><q class="jamesRyder">She told me to ask you.</q></p>
      <p><q class="breckinridge">Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I
            care. I've had enough of it. Get out of this!</q> He rushed
         fiercely forward, and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness.</p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton
            Road,</q> whispered Holmes. <q class="sherlockHolmes">Come
            with me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow.</q>
         Striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring
         stalls, <span class="male" title="sherlockHolmes">my
            companion speedily overtook the little man</span>
         and touched him upon the shoulder. He sprang round, and I could see in the
         gas-light that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face.</p>
      <p><q class="jamesRyder">Who are you, then? What do you want?</q> he asked
         in a quavering voice.</p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">You will excuse me,</q> said Holmes blandly,
         <q class="sherlockHolmes">but I could not help overhearing the
            questions which you put to the salesman just now. I think that I
            could be of assistance to you.</q></p>
      <p><q class="jamesRyder">You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the
            matter?</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to
            know what other people don't know.</q></p>
      <p><q class="jamesRyder">But you can know nothing of this?</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are
            endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott,
            of Brixton Road, to a salesman named Breckinridge, by him in turn to
            Mr. Windigate, of the Alpha, and by him to his club, of which Mr.
            Henry Baker is a member.</q></p>
      <p><q class="jamesRyder">Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to
            meet,</q> cried the little fellow with outstretched hands and
         quivering fingers. <q class="jamesRyder">I can hardly explain to you
            how interested I am in this matter.</q></p>
      <p><span class="male" title="sherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes hailed a
            four-wheeler</span> which was passing. <q class="sherlockHolmes">In that case we had better discuss it in a
            cosy room rather than in this wind-swept market-place,</q> said
         he. <q class="sherlockHolmes">But pray tell me, before we go farther,
            who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting.</q></p>
      <p><span class="male" title="jamesRyder">The man hesitated for an
            instant</span>. <q class="jamesRyder">My name is John
            Robinson,</q> he answered with a sidelong glance.</p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">No, no; the real name,</q> said Holmes
         sweetly. <q class="sherlockHolmes">It is always awkward doing business
            with an alias.</q></p>
      <p>A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. <q class="jamesRyder">Well then,</q> said he, <q class="jamesRyder">my real
            name is James Ryder.</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel
            Cosmopolitan. Pray step into the cab, and I shall soon be able to
            tell you everything which you would wish to know.</q></p>
      <p><span class="male" title="jamesRyder">The little man stood
            glancing from one to the other of us with half-frightened,
            half-hopeful eyes</span>, as one who is not sure whether he is on
         the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. Then <span class="male" title="jamesRyder">he stepped into the
            cab</span>, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room
         at Baker Street. Nothing had been said during our drive, but the high, thin
         breathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of his
         hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him.</p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Here we are!</q> said Holmes cheerily as we
         filed into the room. <q class="sherlockHolmes">The fire looks very
            seasonable in this weather. You look cold, Mr. Ryder. Pray take the
            basket-chair. I will just put on my slippers before we settle this
            little matter of yours. Now, then! You want to know what became of
            those geese?</q></p>
      <p><q class="jamesRyder">Yes, sir.</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one
            bird, I imagine in which you were interested—white, with a black bar
            across the tail.</q></p>
      <p>Ryder quivered with emotion. <q class="jamesRyder">Oh, sir,</q> he
         cried, <q class="jamesRyder">can you tell me where it went
            to?</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">It came here.</q></p>
      <p><q class="jamesRyder">Here?</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I
            don't wonder that you should take an interest in it. It laid an egg
            after it was dead—the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever
            was seen. I have it here in my museum.</q></p>
      <p><span class="male" title="jamesRyder">Our visitor staggered to his
            feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand</span>.
         <span class="male" title="sherlockHolmes">Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue
            carbuncle</span>, which shone out like a star, with a cold,
         brilliant, many-pointed radiance. <span class="male" title="jamesRyder">Ryder stood glaring</span> with a
         drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.</p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">The game's up, Ryder,</q> said Holmes
         quietly. <q class="sherlockHolmes">Hold up, man, or you'll be into the
            fire! Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson. He's not got
            blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. Give him a dash of
            brandy. So! Now he looks a little more human. What a shrimp it is,
            to be sure!</q></p>
      <p>For a moment <span class="male" title="jamesRyder">he had
            staggered and nearly fallen</span>, but the brandy brought a tinge
         of colour into his cheeks, and <span class="male" title="jamesRyder">he sat staring</span> with frightened eyes at his
         accuser.</p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">I have almost every link in my hands, and all the
            proofs which I could possibly need, so there is little which you
            need tell me. Still, that little may as well be cleared up to make
            the case complete. You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the
            Countess of Morcar's?</q></p>
      <p><q class="jamesRyder">It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it,</q>
         said he in a crackling voice.</p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">I see—her ladyship's waiting-maid. Well, the
            temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you,
            as it has been for better men before you; but you were not very
            scrupulous in the means you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there
            is the making of a very pretty villain in you. You knew that this
            man Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter
            before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him.
            What did you do, then? <span class="male" title="jamesRyder">You made some small job</span> in my
            lady's room—you and your confederate Cusack—and <span class="male" title="jamesRyder">you managed
               that he should be the man sent for</span>. Then, when he
            had left, <span class="male" title="jamesRyder">you
               rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this
               unfortunate man arrested</span>. You then—</q></p>
      <p><span class="male" title="jamesRyder">Ryder threw himself down
            suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companion's knees</span>.
         <q class="jamesRyder">For God's sake, have mercy!</q> he
         shrieked. <q class="jamesRyder">Think of my father! Of my mother! It
            would break their hearts. I never went wrong before! I never will
            again. I swear it. I'll swear it on a Bible. Oh, don't bring it into
            court! For Christ's sake, don't!</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Get back into your chair!</q> said Holmes
         sternly. <q class="sherlockHolmes">It is very well to cringe and crawl
            now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner in the dock
            for a crime of which he knew nothing.</q></p>
      <p><q class="jamesRyder">I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country,
            sir. Then the charge against him will break down.</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear
            a true account of the next act. How came the stone into the goose,
            and how came the goose into the open market? Tell us the truth, for
            there lies your only hope of safety.</q></p>
      <p>Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips. <q class="jamesRyder">I will
            tell you it just as it happened, sir,</q> said he. <q class="jamesRyder">When Horner had been arrested, it seemed to me
            that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once, for
            I did not know at what moment the police might not take it into
            their heads to search me and my room. There was no place about the
            hotel where it would be safe. <span class="male" title="jamesRyder">I went out, as if on some
               commission</span>, and <span class="male" title="jamesRyder">I made for my sister's
               house</span>. She had married a man named Oakshott, and
            lived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for the market. All
            the way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a
            detective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was
            pouring down my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister
            asked me what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her
            that I had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then
            <span class="male" title="jamesRyder">I went into the back yard and smoked a
               pipe</span> and wondered what it would be best to
            do.</q></p>
      <p><q class="jamesRyder">I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the
            bad, and has just been serving his time in Pentonville. One day he
            had met me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how
            they could get rid of what they stole. I knew that he would be true
            to me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I made up my mind
            to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my
            confidence. He would show me how to turn the stone into money. But
            how to get to him in safety? <span class="male" title="jamesRyder">I thought of the agonies I
               had gone through in coming from the hotel</span>. I might
            at any moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone
            in my waistcoat pocket. <span class="male" title="jamesRyder">I was leaning against the
               wall</span> at the time and looking at the geese which
            were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly an idea came into my
            head which showed me how I could beat the best detective that ever
            lived.</q></p>
      <p><q class="jamesRyder">My sister had told me some weeks before that I might
            have the pick of her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that
            she was always as good as her word. <span class="male" title="jamesRyder">I would take my
               goose</span> now, and in it I would carry my stone to
            Kilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this
            <span class="male" title="jamesRyder">I drove one of the birds</span>—a fine big
            one, white, with a barred tail. <span class="male" title="jamesRyder">I caught it</span>, and
            prying its bill open, <span class="male" title="jamesRyder">I thrust the stone down its throat</span>
            as far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt
            the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. But the
            creature flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what
            was the matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose
            and fluttered off among the others.</q></p>
      <p><q class="jamesRyder"><q class="maggieRyder">Whatever were you doing
               with that bird, Jem?</q><br/> says she. <q class="jamesRyder">Well,</q><br/> said I, <q class="jamesRyder">you said you'd give me one for
               Christmas, and I was feeling which was the fattest.</q><br/>
            <q class="maggieRyder">Oh,</q><br/> says she, <q class="maggieRyder">we've set yours aside for you—Jem's
               bird, we call it. It's the big white one over yonder.
               There's twenty-six of them, which makes one for you, and one
               for us, and two dozen for the market.</q><br/>
            <q class="jamesRyder">Thank you, Maggie,</q><br/> says I; <q class="jamesRyder">but if it is all the same to you, I'd
               rather have that one I was handling just now.</q><br/>
            <q class="maggieRyder">The other is a good three pound
               heavier,</q><br/> said she, <q class="maggieRyder">and we
               fattened it expressly for you.</q><br/>
            <q class="jamesRyder">Never mind. I'll have the other, and I'll
               take it now,</q><br/> said I. <q class="maggieRyder">Oh,
               just as you like,</q><br/> said she, a little huffed. <q class="maggieRyder">Which is it you want, then?</q><br/>
            <q class="jamesRyder">That white one with the barred tail,
               right in the middle of the flock.</q><br/>
            <q class="maggieRyder">Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with
               you.</q></q></p>
      <p><q class="jamesRyder">Well, <span class="male" title="jamesRyder">I did what she said</span>, Mr. Holmes,
            and <span class="male" title="jamesRyder">I carried
               the bird all the way to Kilburn</span>. <span class="male" title="jamesRyder">I told my pal what
               I had done</span>, for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like
            that to. He laughed until he choked, and we got a knife and opened
            the goose. My heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the
            stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. <span class="male" title="jamesRyder">I left
               the bird, rushed back to my sister's, and hurried into the back
               yard.</span> There was not a bird to be seen there.</q></p>
      <p><q class="jamesRyder"><q class="jamesRyder">Where are they all,
               Maggie?</q><br/> I cried. <q class="maggieRyder">Gone to
               the dealer</q><br/>s, Jem.' <q class="jamesRyder">Which
               dealer's?</q><br/>
            <q class="maggieRyder">Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.</q><br/>
            <q class="jamesRyder">But was there another with a barred
               tail?</q><br/> I asked, <q class="jamesRyder">the same as
               the one I chose?</q><br/>
            <q class="maggieRyder">Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed
               ones, and I could never tell them apart.</q></q></p>
      <p><q class="jamesRyder">Well, then, of course I saw it all, and <span class="male" title="jamesRyder">I ran off as
               hard as my feet would carry me</span> to this man Breckinridge; but he had
            sold the lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where
            they had gone. You heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has
            always answered me like that. My sister thinks that I am going mad.
            Sometimes I think that I am myself. And now—and now I am myself a
            branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which I
            sold my character. God help me! God help me!</q> He burst into
         convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.</p>
      <p>There was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and by the measured
         tapping of Sherlock Holmes' finger-tips upon the edge of the table. Then my
         friend rose and threw open the door.</p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">Get out!</q> said he.</p>
      <p><q class="jamesRyder">What, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!</q></p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">No more words. Get out!</q></p>
      <p>And no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon the stairs, the
         bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the
         street.</p>
      <p><q class="sherlockHolmes">After all, Watson,</q> said Holmes, reaching
         up his hand for his clay pipe, <q class="sherlockHolmes">I am not
            retained by the police to supply their deficiencies. If Horner were
            in danger it would be another thing; but this fellow will not appear
            against him, and the case must collapse. I suppose that I am
            commuting a felony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul.
            This fellow will not go wrong again; he is too terribly frightened.
            Send him to gaol now, and you make him a gaol-bird for life.
            Besides, it is the season of forgiveness. Chance has put in our way
            a most singular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its own
            reward. If you will have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we
            will begin another investigation, in which, also a bird will be the
            chief feature.</q></p>
