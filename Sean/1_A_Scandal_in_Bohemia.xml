    <title>I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA</title>

<story>
      
<chapter number="1">

<p>
To Sherlock<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char> she is always _the_ woman. I have seldom heard him
mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and
predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion
akin to love for <char gender = "female" name = "ireneAdler">Irene Adler</char>. All emotions, and that one particularly,
were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He
was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that
the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a
false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe
and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for
drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained
reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely
adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might
throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive
instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not
be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And
yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late <char gender = "female" name = "ireneAdler">Irene
Adler</char>, of dubious and questionable memory.
</p>

<p>
I had seen little of<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char> lately. My marriage had drifted us away
from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred
interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master
of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention,
while<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char>, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian
soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old
books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition,
the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen
nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime,
and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of
observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those
mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.
From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his
summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up
of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and
finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and
successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of
his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of
the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.
</p>

<p>
One night—it was on the twentieth of March, 1888—I was returning from a
journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when
my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered
door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and
with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a
keen desire to see<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char> again, and to know how he was employing his
extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I
looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette
against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his
head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who
knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own
story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created
dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell
and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.
</p>

<p>
His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,
to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved
me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a
spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire
and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.
</p>

<p>
   <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Wedlock suits you,</quote> he remarked. <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">I think,<char gender = "male" name = "johnWatson">Watson</char>, that you have put
on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Seven!</quote> I answered.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I
fancy,<char gender = "male" name = "johnWatson">Watson</char>. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me
that you intended to go into harness.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Then, how do you know?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting
yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless
servant girl?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">My dear<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char>,</quote> said I, <quote speaker="johnWatson">this is too much. You would certainly have
been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a
country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I
have changed my clothes I can’t imagine how you deduce it. As to <char gender = "female" name = "Mary Jane">Mary
Jane</char>, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there,
again, I fail to see how you work it out.</quote>
</p>

<p>
He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">It is simplicity itself,</quote> said he; <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">my eyes tell me that on the inside
of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is
scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by
someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in
order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double
deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a
particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As
to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of
iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right
forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where
he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not
pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.</quote>
</p>

<p>
I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his
process of deduction. <quote speaker="johnWatson">When I hear you give your reasons,</quote> I remarked,
<quote speaker="johnWatson">the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I
could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your
reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I
believe that my eyes are as good as yours.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Quite so,</quote> he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself
down into an armchair. <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">You see, but you do not observe. The
distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps
which lead up from the hall to this room.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Frequently.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">How often?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Well, some hundreds of times.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Then how many are there?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">How many? I don’t know.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just
my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have
both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these
little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two
of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.</quote> He threw
over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open
upon the table. <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">It came by the last post,</quote> said he. <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Read it aloud.</quote>
</p>

<p>
The note was undated, and without either signature or address.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o’clock,</quote> it
said, <quote speaker="johnWatson">a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very
deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of
Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with
matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.
This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your
chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor
wear a mask.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">This is indeed a mystery,</quote> I remarked. <quote speaker="johnWatson">What do you imagine that it
means?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has
data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of
theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from
it?</quote>
</p>

<p>
I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was
written.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,</quote> I remarked,
endeavouring to imitate my companion’s processes. <quote speaker="johnWatson">Such paper could not
be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and
stiff.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Peculiar—that is the very word,</quote> said<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char>. <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">It is not an English
paper at all. Hold it up to the light.</quote>
</p>

<p>
I did so, and saw a large "E" with a small "g", a "P", and a large "G"
with a small "t" woven into the texture of the paper.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">What do you make of that?</quote> asked<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char>.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Not at all. The ‘G’ with the small ‘t’ stands for ‘Gesellschaft,’
which is the German for ‘Company.’ It is a customary contraction like
our ‘Co.’ ‘P,’ of course, stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the ‘Eg.’ Let us
glance at our Continental Gazetteer.</quote> He took down a heavy brown volume
from his shelves. <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Eglow, Eglonitz—here we are, Egria. It is in a
German-speaking country—in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. ‘Remarkable
as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous
glass-factories and paper-mills.’ Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of
that?</quote> His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud
from his cigarette.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">The paper was made in Bohemia,</quote> I said.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the
peculiar construction of the sentence—‘This account of you we have from
all quarters received.’ A Frenchman or Russian could not have written
that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only
remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who
writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his
face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our
doubts.</quote>
</p>

<p>
As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses’ hoofs and grating
wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell.<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char>
whistled.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">A pair, by the sound,</quote> said he. <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Yes,</quote> he continued, glancing out of
the window. <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred
and fifty guineas apiece. There’s money in this case,<char gender = "male" name = "johnWatson">Watson</char>, if there
is nothing else.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">I think that I had better go,<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char>.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell.
And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">But your client—</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes.
Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.</quote>
</p>

<p>
A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the
passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and
authoritative tap.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Come in!</quote> said<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char>.
</p>

<p>
A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches
in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich
with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad
taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and
fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was
thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and
secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming
beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were
trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of
barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He
carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper
part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard
mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand
was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face
he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip,
and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length
of obstinacy.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="kingBohemia">You had my note?</quote> he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly
marked German accent. <quote speaker="kingBohemia">I told you that I would call.</quote> He looked from
one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Pray take a seat,</quote> said<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char>. <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">This is my friend and colleague, <char gender = "male" name = "johnWatson">Dr.
Watson</char>, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom
have I the honour to address?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="kingBohemia">You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I
understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and
discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme
importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you
alone.</quote>
</p>

<p>
I rose to go, but<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char> caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into
my chair. <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">It is both, or none,</quote> said he. <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">You may say before this
gentleman anything which you may say to me.</quote>
</p>

<p>
The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. <quote speaker="kingBohemia">Then I must begin,</quote> said he,
<quote speaker="kingBohemia">by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of
that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too
much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon
European history.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">I promise,</quote> said<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char>.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">And I.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="kingBohemia">You will excuse this mask,</quote> continued our strange visitor. <quote speaker="kingBohemia">The august
person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may
confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is
not exactly my own.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">I was aware of it,</quote> said<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char> dryly.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="kingBohemia">The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to
be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and
seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak
plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary
kings of Bohemia.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">I was also aware of that,</quote> murmured<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char>, settling himself down in
his armchair and closing his eyes.
</p>

<p>
Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,
lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the
most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe.<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char>
slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">If your <char gender = "male" name = "kingBohemia">Majesty</char> would condescend to state your case,</quote> he remarked, <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">I
should be better able to advise you.</quote>
</p>

<p>
The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in
uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore
the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. <quote speaker="kingBohemia">You are right,</quote>
he cried; <quote speaker="kingBohemia">I am the <char gender = "male" name = "kingBohemia">King</char>. Why should I attempt to conceal it?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Why, indeed?</quote> murmured<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char>. <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Your <char gender = "male" name = "kingBohemia">Majesty</char> had not spoken before I
was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von
Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary <char gender = "male" name = "kingBohemia">King</char> of
Bohemia.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="kingBohemia">But you can understand,</quote> said our strange visitor, sitting down once
more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, <quote speaker="kingBohemia">you can
understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own
person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to
an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come _incognito_
from Prague for the purpose of consulting you.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Then, pray consult,</quote> said<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char>, shutting his eyes once more.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="kingBohemia">The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy
visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress,
<char gender = "female" name = "ireneAdler">Irene Adler</char>. The name is no doubt familiar to you.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,</quote> murmured<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char> without
opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing
all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to
name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish
information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between
that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a
monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Let me see!</quote> said<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char>. <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858.
Contralto—hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw—yes!
Retired from operatic stage—ha! Living in London—quite so! Your
<char gender = "male" name = "kingBohemia">Majesty</char>, as I understand, became entangled with this young person,
wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting
those letters back.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="kingBohemia">Precisely so. But how—</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Was there a secret marriage?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="kingBohemia">None.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">No legal papers or certificates?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="kingBohemia">None.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Then I fail to follow your <char gender = "male" name = "kingBohemia">Majesty</char>. If this young person should
produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to
prove their authenticity?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="kingBohemia">There is the writing.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Pooh, pooh! Forgery.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="kingBohemia">My private note-paper.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Stolen.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="kingBohemia">My own seal.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Imitated.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="kingBohemia">My photograph.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Bought.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="kingBohemia">We were both in the photograph.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your <char gender = "male" name = "kingBohemia">Majesty</char> has indeed committed an
indiscretion.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="kingBohemia">I was mad—insane.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">You have compromised yourself seriously.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="kingBohemia">I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">It must be recovered.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="kingBohemia">We have tried and failed.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Your <char gender = "male" name = "kingBohemia">Majesty</char> must pay. It must be bought.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="kingBohemia">She will not sell.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Stolen, then.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="kingBohemia">Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her
house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has
been waylaid. There has been no result.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">No sign of it?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="kingBohemia">Absolutely none.</quote>
</p>

<p>
Holmes laughed. <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">It is quite a pretty little problem,</quote> said he.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="kingBohemia">But a very serious one to me,</quote> returned the <char gender = "male" name = "kingBohemia">King</char> reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="kingBohemia">To ruin me.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">But how?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="kingBohemia">I am about to be married.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">So I have heard.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="kingBohemia">To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the <char gender = "male" name = "kingBohemia">King</char> of
Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is
herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct
would bring the matter to an end.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">And <char gender = "female" name = "ireneAdler">Irene Adler</char>?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="kingBohemia">Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that
she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She
has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most
resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no
lengths to which she would not go—none.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">You are sure that she has not sent it yet?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="kingBohemia">I am sure.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">And why?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="kingBohemia">Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the
betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Oh, then we have three days yet,</quote> said<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char> with a yawn. <quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">That is
very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into
just at present. Your <char gender = "male" name = "kingBohemia">Majesty</char> will, of course, stay in London for the
present?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="kingBohemia">Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count
Von Kramm.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="kingBohemia">Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Then, as to money?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="kingBohemia">You have _carte blanche_.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">Absolutely?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="kingBohemia">I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to
have that photograph.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="sherlockHolmes">And for present expenses?</quote>
</p>

<p>
The <char gender = "male" name = "kingBohemia">King</char> took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid
it on the table.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,</quote> he
said.
</p>

<p>
Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it
to him.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">And Mademoiselle’s address?</quote> he asked.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John’s Wood.</quote>
</p>

<p>
Holmes took a note of it. <quote speaker="johnWatson">One other question,</quote> said he. <quote speaker="johnWatson">Was the
photograph a cabinet?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">It was.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Then, good-night, your <char gender = "male" name = "kingBohemia">Majesty</char>, and I trust that we shall soon have
some good news for you. And good-night,<char gender = "male" name = "johnWatson">Watson</char>,</quote> he added, as the
wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. <quote speaker="johnWatson">If you will be
good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o’clock I should like
to chat this little matter over with you.</quote>
</p>

<chapter number="2">

<p>
At three o’clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char> had not
yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house
shortly after eight o’clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire,
however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be.
I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was
surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were
associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still,
the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a
character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the
investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his
masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which
made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the
quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable
mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very
possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.
</p>

<p>
It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking
groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and
disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my
friend’s amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three
times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he
vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes
tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his
pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed
heartily for some minutes.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Well, really!</quote> he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he
was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">What is it?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">It’s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed
my morning, or what I ended by doing.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">I can’t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and
perhaps the house, of Miss <char gender = "female" name = "ireneAdler">Irene Adler</char>.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however.
I left the house a little after eight o’clock this morning in the
character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and
freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all
that there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a _bijou_
villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to
the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on
the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor,
and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could
open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window
could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and
examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting
anything else of interest.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">“I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there
was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent
the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in
exchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco,
and as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say
nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was
not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to
listen to.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">And what of <char gender = "female" name = "ireneAdler">Irene Adler</char>?</quote> I asked.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Oh, she has turned all the men’s heads down in that part. She is the
daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the
Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives
out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom
goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male
visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing,
never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey
Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a
confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews,
and knew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, I
began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think
over my plan of campaign.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">“This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter.
He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between
them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client,
his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably
transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less
likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should
continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the
gentleman’s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it
widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these
details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are
to understand the situation.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">I am following you closely,</quote> I answered.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up
to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably
handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached—evidently the man of whom
I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman
to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of
a man who was thoroughly at home.</quote>
</p>

<p>
“He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of
him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking
excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently
he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to
the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it
earnestly, ‘Drive like the devil,’ he shouted, ‘first to Gross &amp;
Hankey’s in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the
Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!’
</p>

<p>
“Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well
to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman
with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all
the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn’t
pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only
caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with
a face that a man might die for.
</p>

<p>
“‘The Church of St. Monica, John,’ she cried, ‘and half a sovereign if
you reach it in twenty minutes.’
</p>

<p>
“This was quite too good to lose,<char gender = "male" name = "johnWatson">Watson</char>. I was just balancing whether
I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a
cab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby
fare, but I jumped in before he could object. ‘The Church of St.
Monica,’ said I, ‘and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty
minutes.’ It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was
clear enough what was in the wind.
</p>

<p>
“My cabby drove fast. I don’t think I ever drove faster, but the others
were there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses
were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried
into the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had
followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with
them. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I
lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a
church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to
me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.
</p>

<p>
“‘Thank God,’ he cried. ‘You’ll do. Come! Come!’
</p>

<p>
“‘What then?’ I asked.
</p>

<p>
“‘Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won’t be legal.’
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">“I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I
found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and
vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in
the secure tying up of <char gender = "female" name = "ireneAdler">Irene Adler</char>, spinster, to Godfrey Norton,
bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman
thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the
clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position
in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it
that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some
informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused
to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky
appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the
streets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I
mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">This is a very unexpected turn of affairs,</quote> said I; <quote speaker="johnWatson">and what then?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the
pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt
and energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they
separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. ‘I
shall drive out in the park at five as usual,’ she said as she left
him. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I
went off to make my own arrangements.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Which are?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Some cold beef and a glass of beer,</quote> he answered, ringing the bell. <quote speaker="johnWatson">I
have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still
this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">I shall be delighted.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">You don’t mind breaking the law?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Not in the least.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Nor running a chance of arrest?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Not in a good cause.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Oh, the cause is excellent!</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Then I am your man.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">I was sure that I might rely on you.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">But what is it you wish?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you.
Now,</quote> he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our
landlady had provided, <quote speaker="johnWatson">I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not
much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene
of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at
seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">And what then?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur.
There is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere,
come what may. You understand?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">I am to be neutral?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small
unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed
into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window
will open. You are to station yourself close to that open window.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Yes.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Yes.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">And when I raise my hand—so—you will throw into the room what I give
you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You
quite follow me?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Entirely.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">It is nothing very formidable,</quote> he said, taking a long cigar-shaped
roll from his pocket. <quote speaker="johnWatson">It is an ordinary plumber’s smoke-rocket, fitted
with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is
confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up
by quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the
street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made
myself clear?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at
the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and
to wait you at the corner of the street.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Precisely.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Then you may entirely rely on me.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare
for the new role I have to play.</quote>
</p>

<p>
He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the
character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His
broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic
smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such
as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that
Holmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul
seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a
fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a
specialist in crime.
</p>

<p>
It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still
wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine
Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as
we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming
of its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from
Sherlock<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char>’ succinct description, but the locality appeared to be
less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a
quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of
shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a
scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a
nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and
down with cigars in their mouths.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">You see,</quote> remarked<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char>, as we paced to and fro in front of the
house, <quote speaker="johnWatson">this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes
a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse
to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming
to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find
the photograph?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Where, indeed?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet
size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman’s dress. She knows
that the <char gender = "male" name = "kingBohemia">King</char> is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two
attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that
she does not carry it about with her.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Where, then?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am
inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like
to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else?
She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what
indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a
business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within
a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be
in her own house.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">But it has twice been burgled.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Pshaw! They did not know how to look.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">But how will you look?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">I will not look.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">What then?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">I will get her to show me.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">But she will refuse.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her
carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.</quote>
</p>

<p>
As he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the
curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to
the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at
the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a
copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with
the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by
the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the
scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was
struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage,
was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who
struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks.<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char>
dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her,
he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely
down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one
direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better
dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it,
crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene
Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she
stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of
the hall, looking back into the street.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Is the poor gentleman much hurt?</quote> she asked.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">He is dead,</quote> cried several voices.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">No, no, there’s life in him!</quote> shouted another. <quote speaker="johnWatson">But he’ll be gone
before you can get him to hospital.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">He’s a brave fellow,</quote> said a woman. <quote speaker="johnWatson">They would have had the lady’s
purse and watch if it hadn’t been for him. They were a gang, and a
rough one, too. Ah, he’s breathing now.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">He can’t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa.
This way, please!</quote>
</p>

<p>
Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the
principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by
the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn,
so that I could see<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char> as he lay upon the couch. I do not know
whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he
was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of
myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I
was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon
the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char>
to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened
my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I
thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from
injuring another.
</p>

<p>
Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who
is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At
the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my
rocket into the room with a cry of <quote speaker="johnWatson">Fire!</quote> The word was no sooner out
of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and
ill—gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids—joined in a general shriek of
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Fire!</quote> Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the
open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later
the voice of<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char> from within assuring them that it was a false
alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner
of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend’s arm
in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly
and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the
quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">You did it very nicely, Doctor,</quote> he remarked. <quote speaker="johnWatson">Nothing could have been
better. It is all right.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">You have the photograph?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">I know where it is.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">And how did you find out?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">She showed me, as I told you she would.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">I am still in the dark.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">I do not wish to make a mystery,</quote> said he, laughing. <quote speaker="johnWatson">The matter was
perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was
an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">I guessed as much.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the
palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my
face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">That also I could fathom.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could
she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I
suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to
see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were
compelled to open the window, and you had your chance.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">How did that help you?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire,
her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It
is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken
advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it
was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married
woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box.
Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house
more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to
secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting
were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The
photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right
bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as
she half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she
replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have
not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the
house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once;
but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it
seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">And now?</quote> I asked.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the <char gender = "male" name = "kingBohemia">King</char>
to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown
into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that
when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be
a satisfaction to his <char gender = "male" name = "kingBohemia">Majesty</char> to regain it with his own hands.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">And when will you call?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a
clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a
complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the <char gender = "male" name = "kingBohemia">King</char> without
delay.</quote>
</p>

<p>
We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was
searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Good-night, Mister Sherlock<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char>.</quote>
</p>

<p>
There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting
appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">I’ve heard that voice before,</quote> said<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char>, staring down the dimly lit
street. <quote speaker="johnWatson">Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.</quote>

<p>
I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast
and coffee in the morning when the <char gender = "male" name = "kingBohemia">King</char> of Bohemia rushed into the
room.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">You have really got it!</quote> he cried, grasping Sherlock<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char> by either
shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Not yet.</quote>

</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">I am in hopes that she does.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">And why in hopes?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Because it would spare your <char gender = "male" name = "kingBohemia">Majesty</char> all fear of future annoyance. If
the lady loves her husband, she does not love your <char gender = "male" name = "kingBohemia">Majesty</char>. If she does
not love your <char gender = "male" name = "kingBohemia">Majesty</char>, there is no reason why she should interfere with
your <char gender = "male" name = "kingBohemia">Majesty</char>’s plan.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">It is true. And yet—! Well! I wish she had been of my own station!
What a queen she would have made!</quote> He relapsed into a moody silence,
which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.

<p>
The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the
steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the
brougham.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Mr. Sherlock<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char>, I believe?</quote> said she.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">I am Mr.<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char>,</quote> answered my companion, looking at her with a
questioning and rather startled gaze.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left
this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for
the Continent.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">What!</quote> Sherlock<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char> staggered back, white with chagrin and
surprise. <quote speaker="johnWatson">Do you mean that she has left England?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Never to return.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">And the papers?</quote> asked the <char gender = "male" name = "kingBohemia">King</char> hoarsely. <quote speaker="johnWatson">All is lost.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">We shall see.</quote> He pushed past the servant and rushed into the
drawing-room, followed by the <char gender = "male" name = "kingBohemia">King</char> and myself. The furniture was
scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open
drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight.
Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and,
plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The
photograph was of <char gender = "female" name = "ireneAdler">Irene Adler</char> herself in evening dress, the letter was
superscribed to <quote speaker="johnWatson">Sherlock<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char>, Esq. To be left till called for.</quote> My
friend tore it open, and we all three read it together. It was dated at
midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,—You really did it very well. You took
me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a
suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I
began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had
been told that, if the <char gender = "male" name = "kingBohemia">King</char> employed an agent, it would certainly
be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you
made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became
suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old
clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself.
Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the
freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you,
ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I call them, and came
down just as you departed.</quote>
</p>

<p>
“Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was
really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char>.
Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for
the Temple to see my husband.
</p>

<p>
“We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so
formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you
call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in
peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The <char gender = "male" name = "kingBohemia">King</char> may do
what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly
wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a
weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might
take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to
possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char>,
</p>

<p>
“Very truly yours,
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">What a woman—oh, what a woman!</quote> cried the <char gender = "male" name = "kingBohemia">King</char> of Bohemia, when we had
all three read this epistle. <quote speaker="johnWatson">Did I not tell you how quick and resolute
she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity
that she was not on my level?</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">From what I have seen of the lady, she seems, indeed, to be on a very
different level to your <char gender = "male" name = "kingBohemia">Majesty</char>,</quote> said<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char> coldly. <quote speaker="johnWatson">I am sorry that
I have not been able to bring your <char gender = "male" name = "kingBohemia">Majesty</char>’s business to a more
successful conclusion.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">On the contrary, my dear sir,</quote> cried the <char gender = "male" name = "kingBohemia">King</char>; <quote speaker="johnWatson">nothing could be more
successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as
safe as if it were in the fire.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">I am glad to hear your <char gender = "male" name = "kingBohemia">Majesty</char> say so.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward
you. This ring—</quote> He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and
held it out upon the palm of his hand.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Your <char gender = "male" name = "kingBohemia">Majesty</char> has something which I should value even more highly,</quote>
said<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char>.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">You have but to name it.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">This photograph!</quote>
</p>

<p>
The <char gender = "male" name = "kingBohemia">King</char> stared at him in amazement.
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">Irene’s photograph!</quote> he cried. <quote speaker="johnWatson">Certainly, if you wish it.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote speaker="johnWatson">I thank your <char gender = "male" name = "kingBohemia">Majesty</char>. Then there is no more to be done in the matter.
I have the honour to wish you a very good morning.</quote> He bowed, and,
turning away without observing the hand which the <char gender = "male" name = "kingBohemia">King</char> had stretched
out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.
</p>

<p>
And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of
Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock<char gender = "male" name = "sherlockHolmes">Holmes</char> were beaten by a
woman’s wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I
have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of <char gender = "female" name = "ireneAdler">Irene Adler</char>, or
when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable
title of _the_ woman.
